	PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT. Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant were, on Monday, put upon their trial before a special jury, in the Queen’s Bench Division, on a charge of having published an obscene book entitled “The Fruits of Philosophy.” The case for the prosecution having been stated by the Solicitor General, Mrs. Besant addressed the jury in her own defence, and had not finished when the Court arose. On Tuesday she resumed, and concluded her address, when Mr. Bradlaugh began his speech on his own behalf. On Wednesday he concluded, and called several witnesses for the defence. On Thursday Mrs. Besant summed up her own case very briefly, and in conclusion she besought the jury not to send her to herd with common women, whose company would be to her torture. Mr. Bradlaugh also summed up his case, and especially dwelt upon, the force of evidence that had been offered for the defence. The Solicitor General having replied on behalf of the prosecution, the Lord Chief Justice summed up, saying a more ill-advised prosecution was probably never brought into a court of justice. The jury, after a retirement of an hour and a half, returned with a verdict that the book published by defendants was illegal, but that they had not been actuated by an improper motive in issuing it. As this, under the indictment, was equivalent to a verdict of guilty the defendants were directed to appear before the Court, that day week for judgment.
