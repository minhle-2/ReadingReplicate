MR. BRADLAUGH DEFYING THE LAW ---- A meeting was held at the Hall of Freedom, in Bristol on Monday night, to discuss the population question, and to establish a branch of what of what is called the Malthusian League. The principal speakers were Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. The letter said they had no idea of flinching, and no effort must be made by their friends to obtain a pardon or a remission of sentence. Mr. Bradlaugh said when the ill-advised prosecution was begun, the circulation of the “Fruits of Philosophy” was 700 or 800, but since the sentence had been pronounced 133,000 copies had been sold, and sold at absurd prices. Mr. Bradlaugh then referred to his appeal to the court of Error, and said if he was defeated there he would take the case to the Court of Appeal, and if he was beaten there. He would go to Holloway Gaol, and he would continue to sell the book from there leaving it to the prosecution to find out how he did it.
