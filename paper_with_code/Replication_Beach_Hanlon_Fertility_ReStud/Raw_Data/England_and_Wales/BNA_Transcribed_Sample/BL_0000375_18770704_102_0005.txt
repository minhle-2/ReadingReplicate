JUDGGMENT OF MRS. BESANT AND MR. BRADLAUGH
----------
SEVER SENTENCE.
In the Queen’s Bench Division, the Solicitor-General prayed judgment in the case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. After some prelimanries  the Lord Chief Justice, having consulted with justice Mellor, said, had defendants announced in Court that, having acted in error, as the jury found they did, they were ready to submit to the law, the Court was prepared to have allowed them to go at liberty on their own recognisances; but, instead of this, they had since the verdict set the law at defiance by continuing the publication. The offence now assumed a very grave character. The sentence was that they be each imprisoned for six months, pay a fine of £200, and enter in to recongnisances in £500, to be of good behavior for two years. On the application of the defendants, execution was stayed to enable them to appeal, they undertaking to cease the publication of the work meanwhile.
