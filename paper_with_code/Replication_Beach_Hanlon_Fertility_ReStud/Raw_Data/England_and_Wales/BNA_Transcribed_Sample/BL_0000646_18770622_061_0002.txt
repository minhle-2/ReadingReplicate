The verdict in the Bradlaugh-Besant case was given yesterday, the jury finding that the book in question was calculated to deprave the public morals. They, however, entirely exonerated the defendant from corrupt motives in publishing the work. This verdict is one of guilty. Sentence was postponed for a week, when the Court, sitting in banco, will consider the exoneration, and also the points raised by Mr. Bradlaugh as to why the indictment should not be quashed. In the course of his summing up, the Lord Chief Justice strongly commented upon the mischievous character and effect of the prosecution, which had sent a well-nigh unknown work into a very wide and general circulation.
