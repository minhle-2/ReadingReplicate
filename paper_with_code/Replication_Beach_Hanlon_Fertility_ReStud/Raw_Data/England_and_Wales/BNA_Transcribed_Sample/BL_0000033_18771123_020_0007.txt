DR. KENEALY’S “MILLION SIXPENCES” – Some two months since Dr. Kenealy, M.P., submitted to the public a proposal to raise 1,000,000 sixpences, or £25,000., to be employed as an “Election Fund,” presumably to assist in sending to Parliament men pledged to advocate the release of the Claimant and support the “Magna Charta” movement. The appeal made to the sense of justice and patriotism of his countrymen does not appear to have had, after two months trial, a result satisfactory to the member for Stoke, as may be gathered from the following statement which has just been issued by him :- “The million sixpences :- I am sorry that this proposal, intended to raise an election fund for the release of Roger Tichborne, and the advancement of Magna Charta, is likely to be a failure. The enemy are crowing loudly. Be it so! I have done my duty, and if the people will not do theirs I am powerless. Bradlaugh and Besant raised £1,200 in a few weeks. Little more than £20 has been sent to me. ---
E. V. KENEALY, Stoke House, Tavistock Square.”
