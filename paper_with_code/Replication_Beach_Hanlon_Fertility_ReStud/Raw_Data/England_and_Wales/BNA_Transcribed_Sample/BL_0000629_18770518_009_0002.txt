The Secretary of the General Post Office has intimated that he claims the right to open, read, and confiscate, without giving Mr. Bradlaugh any intimation, any works posted by him (Mr. Brandlaugh) that he may choose to consider illegal, and during the past week he has seized the “Free thinker’s Text Book,” by Annie Besant, and the “Fruits of Philosophy” by Dr Knowlton. However much we may be disposed to restrict the circulation of an immoral work, we certainly think that the secretary of the General Post Office is usurping undue authority, as it is by no means his province to perform the part of a judge with regard to any work which may pass through the hands of the postal authorities. The post office notice goes even further, for it intimates that the post-master-general claims the right to open, read, and confiscate if it pleases him, “any” work posted by Mr. Bradlaugh. How the distinction is to be drawn it is difficult to see, and as other books than the one which new forms the subject of legal inquiry are covered by the notice, the question as to the power to take such action becomes important. This is undoubtedly a some-what monstrous proceeding, and will not, we believe, receive sympathy even from the most ardent opponent of Mr. Bradlaugh and his opinions. If it is a legal mode of procedure on the part of a secretary of post-office to transform himself into a “tribunal of justice,” we trust that this illustration of the “injustice” of the practice will result in its abolition.
