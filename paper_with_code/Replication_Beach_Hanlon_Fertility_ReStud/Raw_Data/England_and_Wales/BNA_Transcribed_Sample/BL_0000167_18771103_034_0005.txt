MR. BRADLAUGH AGAIN IN THE QUEEN’S BENCH.
	In the Queen’s Bench yesterday, Mr. Bradlaugh, accompanied by Mrs. Besant, moved for a rule, calling on the prosecution in the recent case, to show cause why they should not complete the judgment roll in a number of technical particulars. The Lord Chief Justice said his impression was that these objections were cobwebs, but if it should turn out that there had been any irregularity the whole thing could be done over again after the verdict. Rule granted accordingly.
