	THE BRADLAUGH CASE – The action against Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed on Wednesday. Mr. Bradlaugh continued his address, arguing that not one sentence in the pamphlet was directed against marriage, and that the subjects in question were discussed quite as fully and less delicately in “Carpenter’s Physiology,” a book placed in the hands of boys and girls, and which the Recorder who charged the grand jury against him, had presented as a prize. The Lord-Chief Justice interposed observing that the Solicitor-General’s contention was, that details essential in a medical were unnecessary in a book for the public, and might have an evil tendency. Mr. Bradlaugh said the contention amounted to this, that a rich lady might obtain from her physician knowledge which it was criminal to communicate to the poor, to whom it was more essential. Miss Alice Vicary, examined by Mrs. Besant, deposed that she had examined the book, and considered it fit for general circulation. Dr. Drysdale said he did not consider there was anything prurient in the work. The Lord Chief Justice summed up yesterday.
