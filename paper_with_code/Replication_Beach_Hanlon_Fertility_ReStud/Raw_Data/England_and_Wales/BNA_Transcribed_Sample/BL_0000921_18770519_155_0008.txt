THE OPENING OF PARCELS AT THE POST OFFICE.
	Lord JOHN MANNERS, in reply to Mr. P A Taylor, stated that he was not aware that any pamphlets by Mr. Bradlaugh or Mrs. Besant had been detained at the post office an indecent publications, but some copies of The Fruits of Philosophy had been detained, as such, under the 33rd and 34th Vic. The regulation under the Act were approved of by the Treasury in 1870, and, if desired, could be laid on the table.
