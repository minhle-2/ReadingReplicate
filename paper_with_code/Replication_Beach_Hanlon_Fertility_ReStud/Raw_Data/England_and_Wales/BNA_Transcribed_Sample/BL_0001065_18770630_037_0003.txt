		SENTENCE OF MR BRADLAUGH AND MRS BESANT
On Thursday in the Queen's Bench Division Mrs. Besant  and Mr. Charles Bradlaugh came up for sentence for the offence of having published an obscene book of which they had been found guilty. An application to quash the indictment and a contention that the verdict of the jury was substantially one of not guilty having been heard. Affidavits were put in showing that the work had been sold since the verdict. The Lord Chief Justice observed that had the defendants admitted that they were in error and ready to abide by the law, the Court was prepared to have allowed them to go at liberty on their own recognizances, but having set the law at defiance by continuing the publication. The offence had become a very grave one. The defendants were then each sentenced to be imprisoned for six months, to pay a fine of £200, and to enter into recognisances to be of good behaviour for two years. Execution was stayed to enable the defendants to appeal.
