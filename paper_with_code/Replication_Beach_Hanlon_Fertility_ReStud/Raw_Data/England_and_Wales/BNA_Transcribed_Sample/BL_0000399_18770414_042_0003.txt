	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant, a lady who sympathizes with the theological views of the free-thought advocate, have been apprehended by the London police on a charge of having sold a pamphlet the contents of which are described as of an immoral nature. Mr. Bradlaugh maintains that the police are mistaken, as the condemned pamphlet is strictly scientific.
