THE BRADLAUGH-BESANT CASE
In the Queen’s Bench Division yesterday, before the Lord Chief Justice and Justice Mellor, the Solicitor-General showed cause against the rule obtained by Mr. Bradlaugh for a correction in the judgment against him and Mrs. Besant. He observed that Mr. Bradlaugh was in error in supposing that this step would enable him to have the case re-argued. His lordship said it would be a prostitution of justice to go over the case again. Rule refused with coste.
