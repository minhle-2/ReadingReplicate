	MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT --- Sunday the New Hall of Science, Old-street, was densely crowded, it having been announced that Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant were to deliver addresses. Of the 600 persons who filled the hall, one-third were women, many of them very young. Prices of admission ranged from 2d. to 2s. 6d. In the street were some 400 people who were unable to obtain admission. Copies of the “Fruits of Philosophy” were sold by the hundreds, young women and lads purchasing largely. When Mr. Bradlaugh, Mrs. Besant, and Mr. Truelove, of Holborn, entered the hall they were received with great cheering. Mrs. Besant took the chair. She said that on Thursday Mr. Bradlaugh would move in court, and on the same day she proposes to move that the verdict should be entered as a verdict of acquittal, as the word “guilty” was really not contained in the verdict. If she did not succeed it that then she would move that the verdict be set aside and a new trial ordered, so that there should be a verdict one way or the other. If they failed on Thursday they should have to abide by whatever punishment the Lord Chief Justice thought fit to inflict. She was as loyal to the cause as ever and would not flinch from the struggle. Mr. Bradlaugh, who was received with prolonged cheering, said he had received a letter from Joseph Garibaldi, at Caprera, adding his name to the Defence Committee.
