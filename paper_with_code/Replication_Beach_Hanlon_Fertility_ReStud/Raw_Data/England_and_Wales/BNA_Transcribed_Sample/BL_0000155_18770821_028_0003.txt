MR. BRADLAUGH AND HIS SENTENCE
	A meeting was held at the Hall of Freedom, in Bristol, yesterday evening, to discuss the population question, and to establish a branch of the Malthusian League. The principal speakers were Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. The latter said she had no idea of flinching – no thought of surrender. No effect must be made by their friends to obtain a pardon or a remission of sentence. Mr. BRADLAUGH said when the ill-advised prosecution was begun, the circulation of the “Fruits of Philosophy” was 700 or 800 in as many years; but since the sentence had been pronounced, 100,000 copies had been sold and sold at absurd prices. Mr. Bradlaugh then referred to his appeal to the Court of Error, and said that if he was defeated there he would take the case to the Court of Appeal; and if he was defeated there he would appeal to the House of Lord; and if he was beaten there he would go to Holloway Gaol, and he would continue to sell the book from there, leaving it to the prosecution to find out how he did it.
