Poor Mrs. Besant, who was this morning arrested with Bradlaugh, has had an eventful life the wife of a country person, she commenced an energetic career by very enthusiastic support of extreme High Church views. She published tracts and pamphlets intended to prove that Catholic truth was to be found only in the development of Anglicanism to its furthest point. But at last the great question of authority startled her; and instead of following Newman's example and going over to Rome to stifle there the doubts which oppressed her, she parted from Christianity altogether, and quarrelling with her husband, came to London as a Secularist Lecturer. Beautiful and eloquent, she attracted large crowds to the Hall of Science, where Mr. and Mrs. Bradlaugh with their two daughters used to go to admire her feminine force and vigour. The friendship ripened into “a literary partnership;” and now they are charged together as misdemeanants. It is a piteous story and might be regarded as an illustration to the discussion proceeding in the columns of the Nineteenth century upon the possibility of getting rid of theology without danger to morals. Knowlton’s “Fruits of Philosophy” is hardly what would have been called a moral book a few years ago; but such discussions are not unfrequent at the Dialectical Society.
