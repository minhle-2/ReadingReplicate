We do not wish to say much about the BRADLAUGH book, or about the worse “Priest in Absolution” Mr. BRADLAUGH and Mrs. BESANT were treated with perfect fairness on the trial, and, as the LORD CHIRF JUSTICE explained, would have been discharged on their own recognizance if they had stopped the sale of the book after the verdict was delivered. Instead of that the sale went on, and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE sends both Mr. BRADLAUGH and Mrs. BESANT to prison for six months, and mulcts them in a heavy fine. It is a pity that the prosecution was ever instituted, and we should not be sorry if we could have a full and honest statement respecting people who stir the dirty waters of public opinion.
