TRIAL OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
	The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for publishing an obscene book, entitled “Fruits of Philosophy,” commenced at Guildhall today. Several women were present in court, amongst them being Mr. Bradlaugh’s daughter; and, as counsel proceeded to read extracts from the book, the magistrate suggested that it would be becoming if they withdrew. Mr. Bradlaugh stated that the ladies were his witnesses, and as they would not leave the objectionable passages were pointed out and handed to the magistrate to read. After counsel’s address and witnesses for the defence, Mr. Bradlaugh addressed the court for the defence, arguing that the pamphlet did not come within the Acts dealing with obscene literature.
