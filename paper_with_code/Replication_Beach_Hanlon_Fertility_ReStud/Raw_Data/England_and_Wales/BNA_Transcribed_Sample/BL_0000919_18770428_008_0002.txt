	An application was yesterday made in the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice by Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for a writ of certiorari to remove their trial for publishing “The Fruits of Philosophy” from the Central Criminal Court to the Queen’s Bench. The Lord Chief Justice said that before deciding they would read the book.
