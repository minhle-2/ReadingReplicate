THE prosecution of MR. BRADLAUGH and Mrs. BESANT for selling a pamphlet alleged to be immoral was resumed yesterday at the Guildhall. Mr. Bradlaugh compared passages in the pamphlet with others, which he marked, but which were not read, in the works of MALTHUS, J. S. Mill, PROFESSOR and Mrs. FAWCETT, CHEVASSE, Dr. Acton, and others. He stated he should call medical evidence to speak of the serious consequences resulting from ignorance of some of the matters treated in the pamphlet. The case was adjourned.
