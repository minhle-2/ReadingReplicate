MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT IN BRISTOL
Under the auspices of the Malthusian League a meeting was held on Monday evening at the Hall of Freedom, Newfoundland-road, to hear addresses from Mr. Bradlaugh ad Mrs. Besant on the population question. Mr. Cawsey moved, “That the discussion of the population question is of vital importance, and that the attempt to suppress it by prosecution ought to be resisted.” The resolution having been briefly seconded, it was supported in a lengthy speech by Mrs. Besant. In the course of her remarks she said they could not put down discussion by the prosecution; the simply embittered it, inflamed it, and made it more passionate, more hasty and one sided. What she said in the beginning that she would carry this question through, she said again now, when, the threat of the penalty was hanging over her. In no boast did she say these words at the beginning, and with no possibility of boast did she repeat them now, because the only way to close the prison gates was by upsetting the sentence that was passed upon them. Mr. Bradlaugh also supported the resolution. He maintained that the conviction obtained against them carried no faint of shame, and Mrs. Besant and himself intended to fight the question to the House of Lords. If he went to gaol he would sell from outside the gaol, and he would leave the authorities to find out how he did it, if they cared. The sentence was a severe one: but the prison should not stop him, persecution should not hinder him, he would try, as those who went before him, to win respect for his opinions even from those who hated him. The question was asked whether any one wished to propose an amendment, and there being no reply, the resolution was put by Mr. Bradlaugh, and declared carried, with one dissentient.
