THE BRADLAUGH CASE
At the London Guildhall, on Saturday, Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant attended before Sir Thomas Dakin in order to protect themselves in the eyes of the public and the court of Queen’s Bench.
Mr. Bradlaugh said that he and Mrs. Besant had been committed from this court for trial and they were tried and convicted in the court of Queen’s Bench, but pending an appeal from that conviction they were let out on their own nominal recognizances, they pledging their words of honour that they would do nothing, either directly or indirectly, to assist the publication of the book, but, on the contrary, would do all in their power to suppress the sale of it. It had come to their knowledge that a firm on Ludgate hill were sending out circulars stating that they were ready to supply a copy of the pamphlet for private circulation for 3s., the book having been previously sold at 6d. a copy. He went to them, and they assured him that they were not selling it. He was not satisfied with that, but caused a registered letter to be sent from the country to them, asking for a copy of the book, and only two days ago he got the book sent back by the post. He made that statement on behalf of Mrs. Besant and himself, so that it might be publicly known that they were in no way parties to that nefarious circulation.
Sir Thomas Dakin Said he presumed that Mr. Bradlaugh made this statement in defense of himself and Mrs. Besant, to show that they had nothing to do with the circulation.
Mr. Bradlaugh said that he was precisely the case. They did not wish it to be believed that he and Mrs. Besant were taking advantage of their liberty and to play fast and loose with the court that had shown them so much courtesy.
Sir Thomas Dakin said he thought it was a case which the police ought to take up, and look after those parties.
Inspector Pitney said he would report the case the commissioner. 
Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant thanked Sir Thomas Dakin for his courtesy, and retired.
