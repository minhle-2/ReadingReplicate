	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant again appeared at the Guildhall Police-court on Thursday, to answer the charge of having published an indecent book. Mr. Bradlaugh having been heard in defence of the book, and Mrs. Besant having read a statement in which she denied that the book was open to the charge made against it, both prisoners were committed for trial, and were formally bound over in their own recognisances to appear at the Central Criminal Court.
