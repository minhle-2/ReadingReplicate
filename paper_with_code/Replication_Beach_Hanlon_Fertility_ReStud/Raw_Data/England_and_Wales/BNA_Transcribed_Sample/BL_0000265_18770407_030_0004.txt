THE CHARGE AGAINST MR. BRADLAUGH ---- Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant were on Thursday charged at the Guildhall Police-court with having published a book with an immortal tendency. The work is one upon which a prosecution has already been founded, and as a result  it was withdrawn; but it has now been reissued, with the avowed object of testing whether it is, as alleged, an immoral one. Some formal evidence was given, and the hearing was adjourned, the defendants being admitted to bail.
