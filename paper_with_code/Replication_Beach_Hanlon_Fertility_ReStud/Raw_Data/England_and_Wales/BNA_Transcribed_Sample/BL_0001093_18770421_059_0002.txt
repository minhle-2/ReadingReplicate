	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant were charged at the London Guildhall, last Tuesday, with publishing and circulating an immoral book. A large number of “ladies” were present in Court, and it would seem that they decided to remain, notwithstanding the significant remarks of the presiding magistrate. The defendant (Bradlaugh) addressed the Court in his own defence, and said he should call a considerable number of witnesses. The case was adjourned.
