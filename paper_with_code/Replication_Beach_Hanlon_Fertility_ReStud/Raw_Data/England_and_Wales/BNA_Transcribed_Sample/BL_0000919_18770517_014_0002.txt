	It is a long time since …………………………..was charged with tampering with letters and newspapers. Mr. Sendamore, it is true, suppressed telegrams relating to a strike which he was endeavouring to put down, but the postman has not of late years been relieved of his burdens for any reasons of State. It seems, however, that those who keep watch and ward over the morals of St. Martin’s-In-Grand have ………. been paying particular attention to the publications which are forwarded by Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. The censors, it seems, object to those publications. They have stopped both the National Reformer and the Freethinker’s Tack Book, (the latter written by a woman), as unfit even to pass through the post. There is to be a “joily row” about it. Mr. Peter Taylor has taken up Mr. Bradlaugh’s case. Lord John Mannera will have to answer questions and to produce papers, to show “the approval of the Treasury” and the sanction of the law. In fact, Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant will do their best to show the Government that their new Gospel of sparse population has as much right to flourish as any other creed. Meanwhile, their pamphlet is being openly sold in the streets by numerous news vendors.
