	PERSONS who may have wavered as to the justice of the verdict returned, against Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant will, we venture to think, be inclined to accept it as both wise and fair when they learn what took place last Sunday night, at the New Hall of Science, London. There, as is well known, the Secularists air their peculiar views of what will and what will not regenerate mankind; and there on Sunday night occurred a scene calculated to raise a blush on the cheek of any average Englishman. Mrs. Besant, the glib “sub-editor” of Mr. Bradlaugh’s sheet, presided. She is fond of posing wherever “Iconoclast” orates. Some 600 persons were present, having paid for seats at sums varying from 2d to 2s  6d. Of those 600 persons one-third were women, many of whom, according to the Times, were very young. Outside were some 400 people unable to obtain admission. The condemned pamphlet was openly sold by the hundred, among the most greedy purchasers being young women and lads. No ordinary Englishman who has an idea of the subject  matter of the publication which the notorious couple of Atheists are forcing on the public can but regret the Sabbath scandal which took place at the Hall of Science. Whatever, people may say about physiology, about population, about poverty, no right-minded person can think without a shudder of our boys and girls buying up the forbidden pamphlet in the streets of London on a Sunday evening. No amount of valuable scientific information can compensate for the injury to morals, the bodily damage, and soul debasement as sure to follow as night the day the unchecked and promiscuous circulation of the so-called “Fruits of Philosophy.”
