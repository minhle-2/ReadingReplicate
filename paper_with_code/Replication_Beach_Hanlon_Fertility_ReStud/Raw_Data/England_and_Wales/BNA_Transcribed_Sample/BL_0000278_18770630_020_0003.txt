THE BRADLAUGH CASE
	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, found guilty on the 1st inst., of publishing an obscene book, entitled “The Fruits of Philosophy,” were brought up for judgment on Thursday. On the conclusion of the arguments on various points, and it having been shown that the sale of the pamphlet had taken place since the verdict of the jury, and admitted by Mr. Bradlaugh.
	The Lord Chief Justice said the case had now assumed an aggravated character. The Court had been prepared to discharge the defendants in view of the original finding of the jury, had it been shown that the former had done all they could to obey the law. This was not the case, however. They had set the law at defence. The sentence was that they should be imprisoned for the term of six months, that each of them should pay a fine of £200 to the Queen, and that they enter further into their recognizances each into the sum of £500 to be of good behavior for two years. 
	Mr. Bradlaugh asked if execution of the sentence might be stayed.
	The Lord Chief Justice : Certainly not.
	Mr. Bradlaugh said he did not intend to continue the publication of the work.
	The Lord Chief Justice said that in that case if the defendants would enter into their recognizances to be of good behavior, and not to publish the book until the writ of error was decided, he would stay execution of sentence. 
	The defendants entered into the necessary recognizances, and the Lord Chief Justice, in reply to Mr. Bradlaugh, said before the latter left the court that no doubt the conduct of the defendants had been straightforward.
