     THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH.
       In the Queen's Bench Division on Monday Morning, at the sitting or the Court, the Lord Chief Justice, referring to the case of the Queen V. Bradlaugh and Besant, said that he and his brother Mellor had looked through the work published by the defendants, and they were of opinion that the question raised whether the book was a scientific or an obscene work was one which required to be tried by a judge and a special jury. Under these circumstances the writ of certiorari applied for would be granted.
