	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant again appeared at the Guildhall police-court on Thursday, charged with having published a book with an immoral tendency. Both defendants addressed the Court, denying that the work was open to the construction placed upon it. They were bound over in their own recognisances to appear at the Central Criminal Court for trial. Mr. Bradlaugh expressed his intention to take the case, if necessary, to the Court of Queen’s Bench.
