	The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for publishing an obscene work terminated on Thursday, when a verdict of guilty was returned. The foreman of the jury, who had been absent an hour and thirty-five minutes, said they were of opinion that the book was calculated to deprave public morals. They, however, exonerated the defendants from any corrupt motive in publishing the work. The Lord Chief Justice, who had previously characterized the prosecution as ill-advised and injudicious, reserved his sentence for a week.
