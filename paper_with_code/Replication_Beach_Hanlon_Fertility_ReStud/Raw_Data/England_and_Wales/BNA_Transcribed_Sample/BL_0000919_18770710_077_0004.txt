THE “MALTHUSIAN” LEAGUE.

	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant were present at a lecture delivered at the North London Secular Society, Claremont Hall, Penton-street, Islington, on Sunday, evening in order to enroll members into the “Malthusian” League, the objects of which are “to spread among the people a knowledge of the law of population and of its practical application; to agitate for the abolition of all penalties on the public discussion of the population question; and to obtain such a statutory definition as shall render it impossible in the future to bring within the scope of the common law, as a misdemeanour the publication of works dealing with this question.” The hall was crowded in every part, and a number of persons were enrolled as members.
