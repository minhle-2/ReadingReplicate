THE BRADLAUGH-BESANT PROSECUTION
 	In the Queen’s Bench division yesterday, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn gave judgment in the application of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. His lordship said there was matter in the book (“Fruits of Philosophy”) which ought fairly to be left to a special jury to decide as to whether it was bona fide for a scientific purpose, and that the court would grant a writ of certiorari to have the case tried by a special jury at Westminster, instead of at the Central Criminal Court.
