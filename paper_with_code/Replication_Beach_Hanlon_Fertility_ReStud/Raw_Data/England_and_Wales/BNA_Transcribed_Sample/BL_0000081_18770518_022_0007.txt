MR. BRADLAUGH AND THE POSTOFFICE.
 	In reply to Mr. P. A. Taylor, Lord JOHN MASTERS stated that he was not aware that any pamphlets by Mr. Bradlaugh or Mrs. Besant had been detained at the Postoffice as indecent publication; but some copies of the “Fruits of Philosophy” had been detained as such, under the 33rd and 34th Vic. The regulations under the act were approved of by the Treasury in 1870, and if desired could be laid on the table.
