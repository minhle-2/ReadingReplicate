	THE CHARGE AGAINST MR. BRADLAUGH --- Mr. Bradlaugh, who, with Mrs. Besant, was a few days ago committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court by the Guildhall magistrate for publishing an obscene pamphlet, to-day (Friday, 26th inst), applied to the Queen’s Bench Division for a writ of certiorari to remove the trial of the case to that division. The Court, after hearing the application, reserved their decision, taking time to read the pamphlet, the publication of which formed the basis of the prosecution.
