	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh writes to the Times to complain that he was, on Saturday, officially informed from the secretary to the General Post office that the secretary claims the right to open, read, and confiscate, without any intimation to Mr. Bradlaugh, any works posted by Mr. Bradlaugh that the secretary considered illegal, and that he has during the past week seized the “Freethinkers’ Text-book,” by Annie Besant, and the “Fruits of Philosophy,” by Dr. Knowlton.
