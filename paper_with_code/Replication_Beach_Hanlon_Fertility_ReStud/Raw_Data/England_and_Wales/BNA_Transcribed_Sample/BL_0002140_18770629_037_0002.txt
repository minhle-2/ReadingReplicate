Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant came up for judgement in the Queen’s Bench Division yesterday. Mr. Bradlaugh moved to quash the indictment, but the court declined to grant a new trial on the grounds alleged. The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgement, said that at the time of the trail, the court was prepared to liberate them on their own recognisances; but as they had since the verdict set the law at defiance, the offence assumed a very grave character. The defendants were then each sentenced to six months, imprisonment, to pay a fine of £200, and to enter into recognisances for good behaviour for two years. Execution was stayed to allow them to appeal.
