THE BRADLAUGH – BESANT TRIAL
SENTENCE OF THE DEFENDANTS
	In the Queen’s Bench Division, upon Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant coming up for judgment on Thursday, Mr. Bradlaugh moved to quash the indictment on the ground that the words showing the obscenity of the book were not specified in the indictment. Affidavits were placed before the Lord Chief Justice before delivering judgment, that the sale of the pamphlet had been continued since the verdict of the jury had been given. Mr. Bradlaugh admitted this. The Judge said the case had now assumed an aggravated character. The court had been prepared to discharge the defendants if they had obeyed the law, but as they defied the law they would be each imprisoned for six months, pay £200 fine, and enter into recognisances in £500 to be of good behavior for two years. Execution was stayed till the writ of error is decided.
