MR. BRADLAUGH DEFYING THE LAW. 
	A meeting was held in Bristol on Monday night to discuss the population question. The principal speakers were Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. The latter said no idea of flinching, no thought of surrender, and no effort must be made by their friends to obtain a pardon or a remission of sentence. Mr. Bradlaugh referred to his appeal to the Court of Error, and said that if he was defeated there he would take the case to the Court of Appeal, and if he was defeated there he would appeal to the House of Lords, and if he was beaten there he would go to Holloway Gaol, and he would continue to sell the book from there, leaving it to the prosecution to find out how he did it.
