TRIAL OF MR. BRADLAUGH
FOURTH DAY – THURSDAY, JUNE 21ST
	In consequence of the intimation of the Lord Chief Justice that the case would in all probability be concluded today, there was increased eagerness manifested by crowd of persons in Westminster Palace-yard to obtain admission to the gallery. The court, however, was …………………………….and kept from being too crowded.
	When the Lord Chief Justice had taken his rest one ………….the jury handed up a note asking if it was allowable to ………..questions to the defendants. His lordship replied in the negative.
	Mrs. Besant then rose to ………..up the evidence of defence on her part. She expressed her gratification that the case had become narrowed since it was opened by the Solicitor General, and then proceeded to refer briefly to the points of the indictment brought against he by the prosecution, such as publishing an obscene book with the intention of depraving the minds of the young, selling it under the ……………of philosophy, and the colouring of marriage. She put it to the jury ……………………….the book in court spoke dis………………….of marriage, whether also it did not discommend profligacy by warning the young against this vice, and also warning others against the ……………………………………in sexual feeling. As to the ………………. that the language of the book was disgusting, they would remember that the evidence in defence had proved that it was delicate and careful in comparison with ………………….. literature of the ………………….class. she would then ask the jury, were she and her co-defendant to go to prison from that court because they…………………to make known to the world ……………..for ……………………..much of the misery? She was not …………………….the poor, and had …………the right of ……………………………by force of ……………………………Did they then …………………………to send her to …………..among women to …………………….amongst these deprave women whose language would be torture to …………? Let them think …………………………………………………….would mean in her case. It would be ……………………….to the hundreds of thousands of poor women, “Keep to your …………………………………………………………………………from the chains of your misery………………………………………………………..of your sorrow. But if they believed …………………………………………………………..if they ………………in truth, and if they had regard ………………………………………………they…………………………………………………………give her a verdict of acquitted. ……………………………………………………………………verdict of guilty, she would appeal to ………………………………………………………that of history. If…………………………………………..would say that man and that woman who stood before them that day knew the misery of their fellow creatures, and that they joined hands together to ……………………………their depressing sorrow. History, she was sure, would say. “Well done,” whatever their verdict might be.
	Mr. Bradlaugh followed. He argued that he had not ……………………..this book……………………………………………….of ……………………..and defiance, and in conclusion would put it to the jury whether checks in population ought to be allowed when such checks do and destroy life.
	The Solicitor General, in reply, said that the jury would have heard from …………………..defendants that they themselves challenged this inquiry by informing the police that they intended to sell the book at a …………………………………….and at a certain place. Had therefore this prosecution …………………..taken place ………….could have claimed the …………………to sell this book, and to say that they sold it in the City of London after having signified ……………………………….of doing so to the police authorities. It had been said that the ……………………….had given to £10,000; but would that be on if the book was only a …………………..on the liver, the …………………., …………………………… It was because it was an obscene book, …………………………the …………………..of the young, that it ………………………….as largely. It was a dirty, ……………………….and ……………..look, and …………………….man would allow his wife and daughters to read it and its object was to enable persons to have sexual intercourse in ……………….of moral law and the way ………………………….If it was an …………….work it ought not to be ………………….He would …………………that this book recommended that which was …………………………………………………which was in defiance of public morality, and all this was done in ……………………………………….which he could not describe, but would ……………………himself by characterizing it as filthy.
	The Lord Chief Justice then proceeded to sum up the whole case. A users ill-advised prosecution, he said, was probably never bought into a ……………of justice. There was a work which had been published more than forty years, but which appeared not have got into circulation, and had been ………………………………..and ………….into circulation to the ……………of many thousands being to the present ………………………., and when the learned …………………for the ………………………..said the ………………………………….inconsequence of the challenge of the ………………………………….(his lordship) did not agree with him and would like to know who were the …………………………….to whom he referred. ……………………..he would ………………..with the learned counsel in saying that any man had a right to put the criminal law into …………………….and when he had done so he had a right to ask that the prosecution should be properly treated. They had ………………………..a case here which ……………..matter who were the prosecution they ……………settle ………………………….they would begin and he would say that it was ………………..which demanded their most …………………………attention …………….prosecution charged the defendants that I ……………….lawfully and wickedly devoted and contrived ………………….and corrupt youth, and to …………….and to …………………………………………….of ………………….., …………………………….and ………………………..and to bring them into a …………………………………………………..by a book called “Fruits of Philosophy.” They agreed with the learned ……………….that if the book …………………………………be described, the defendants ……………………………………………………………though they might …………………………………………they………………………………………..by the publication. The jury had the ………………………….them and by this time must be ……………………………………………………………..It was now for him to tell ……………………………..was the law. It was not for the people. ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………had a strong and marked tendency to ……………………………………………….faster than the earth and the skill of man could produce food, and consequently that population must include a vast number of persons on when poverty sadly pressed. There was no ………………………that the evils of over-population were real and not imaginary, and it had been …………………….that the only ………………………………of ……………………….., it was late marriages. But, on the other hand, it was said, although you might prevent marriage, you could not restrain the instincts of nature, and therefore the result would be all the evils of profligacy in place of over-population. To prevent the evils of over-population, Dr. Knowlton in this book suggested three or four means. The learned counsel for the prosecution said that those means were wicked and sinful, contrary to the law of Nature, and against the law of God. He argued that when lawful intercourse took place between man and woman, to endeavour to prevent the natural fruits of that intercourse was contrary to all law, natural and divine. The intercourse between the sexes could not be prevented, and if they prevented marriage they provided profligacy or depressing celibacy. The only way, then, according to defendants argument, was to apply artificial checks in married life. But the Solicitor General did not care in what form natural results were defeated. In this case it was wrong. In conclusion, his lordship directed the jury that whatever tended to indecency—whatever ………………to corrupt society --- was, when published an offence against the English law. That was the law of the country, and upon that they would form their verdict.
	The jury retired at a quarter to one and returned into court after the absence of an hour and a half. The foreman, in answer to the usual question as to their verdict, said : We are of opinion that this book is calculated to …………………….public morals, but we entirely exonerate the defendants from any corrupt matters in the publication.
	The Lord Chief Justice pointed out that the verdict was not definite. 
	The clerk : Then you find the defendants guilty?
	The foreman: Yes, guilty.
	The Lord Chief Justice said he would not pass sentence at present. The defendants might come up to court that day week, and he would then give attention to the point which Mr. Bradlaugh had asked him to …………………..and also take into consideration any other circumstance which do ………………desired.
	Mr. Bradlaugh : Then you, will ………….the ………….question till next week, my lord?
	The Lord Chief Justice : Oh, yes.
	There was some …………………..heard at the extreme and of the gallery at the conclusion of the proceedings, and when the defendants were crossing the palace-yard (Mr. Bradlaugh being followed by has two daughters ………………………most …………….for the loss of their mothers, there were some checks and counter cheers. Mrs. Besant appeared much dejected.
