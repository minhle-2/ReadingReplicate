THE CONVICTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH
Mr. Bradlaugh, accompanied by Mrs. Besant, appeared yesterday in the Queen's Bench Division, and moved in person for a rule calling upon Mr. Frederick Cockburn, the Queen's Coroner, end upon the solicitors for the prosecution to show cause why he or they should not complete the judgment roll carried on herein by inserting the actual date when the interlocutory judgment was required to be posted, and also by reciting the several motions made by the defendants herein to quash the indictment for a new trial and an arrest of judgment respectively, and the judgment of the Court on such motion, or why the recital of the interlocutory judgment on the said roll should not be struck out,  why the time for the defendants to transcribe the judgment should not be enlarged, and why in the meantime all further proceedings should not be stayed. 
After hearing Mr. Bradlaugh's remarks as to the irregularities to the trial and sentence on which he founded his motion.
 The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE said it was no use to waste more time. His impression was that these objections were mere cobwebs. If it should turn out there had been any irregularity, the whole thing could be done over again after the verdict, and made regular. 
Rule granted accordingly.
