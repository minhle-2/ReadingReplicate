Mr. Bradlaugh, speaking at Bristol at a meeting called to from a branch of the Malthusian League, said that, although the sale of the “Fruits of Philosophy” used to be about 100 year, since the prosecution of himself and Mrs. Besant over 130,000 copies had been sold. He stated that, if defeated in the Court of Appeal, and if necessary to the House of Lords; and if beaten there he would go to Holloway Goal, and still continue to publish the book.
