We have much satisfaction in calling attention to the correspondence between Dr. Brown and Mr. Agg-Gardner, respecting the Burials' Question, which we publish in another column. The Member for Cheltenham has so pointedly and well expressed the views of all moderate and fair-minded persons on this difficult subject, that we think we should spoil the cogency of his argument were we to water it down by any remarks of our own. It strikes us that he has rather cornered the Doctor. If "any " person has a right to perform in Church of England churchyards whatsoever burial service may be pleasing in his or her right, we do not see oily-thing to prevent Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant chaunting in God's acre, a filthy, disgusting and atheistical dirge called probably "The Fruits of Philosophy," but none the less shocking for any such high-sounding name. Yet this is what Dr. Brown and his "enthusiastic" meeting would bring us to. By the way, did any of our readers, ever hear of that “enthusiastic " meeting until after it had met? It may have been “enthusiastic” it was certainly a hole-and-corner meeting. The three tailors of Tooley-street were doubtless “enthusiastic" enough.
