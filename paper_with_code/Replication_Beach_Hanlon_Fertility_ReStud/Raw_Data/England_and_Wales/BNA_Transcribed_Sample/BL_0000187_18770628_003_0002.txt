	The Bradlaugh prosecution concluded on Thursday. The jury have found that the book was calculated to deprave public morals, but exonerated the defendants from a corrupt motive, and a verdict of guilty was accordingly entered. The sentence was deferred till to-day (Thursday), when the reserved points will be discussed. Mrs. Besant, the heroine of the day, is the niece of ex-Lord Chancellor Hatherley. She is the wife of a clergy man living near Boston, and having bad some difference with her husband some three years ago she separated from him, and since then has been pursuing philanthropic avocations of an independent character. She has two children, and lately attempted to get possession of them, but her husband succeeded in keeping her out of the house. Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, on Saturday night, at the New Hall of Science, London, they spoke on the subject of their prosecution. Mrs. Besant expressed her satisfaction at the summing up of the Lord Chief Justice, and Mr. Bradlaugh promised his hearers to carry his case to the House of Lords if necessary.
