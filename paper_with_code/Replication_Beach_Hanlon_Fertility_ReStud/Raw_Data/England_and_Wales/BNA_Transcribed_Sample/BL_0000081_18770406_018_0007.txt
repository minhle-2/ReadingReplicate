     ARREST OF BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT
Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant, the well-known free thought and advocates, were yesterday morning arrested by the city of London police in the charge of printing and publishing a pamphlet entitled “The Fruits of Philosophy” which it is alleged is of an immoral nature. The prisoners were charged at the Guildhall yesterday afternoon with publishing an obscene book. Bradlaugh contended his own and Mrs. Besant’s defence, and at the suggestion only formal evidence was taken inspecting the sale of book, “The Fruits of Philosophy” at the office of the prisoners. The case was adjourned until the 17th instant, the prisoners being liberated on bail in £200 each. Bradlaugh stated he should have to call about 40 witnesses, and intended this as a test question.
