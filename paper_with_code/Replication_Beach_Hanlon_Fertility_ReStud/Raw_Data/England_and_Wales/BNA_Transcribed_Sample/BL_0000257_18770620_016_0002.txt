       THE PROCESUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH.—The case of “The Quern V. Bradlaugh and Besant" commenced on Monday morning in the Queen's Bench Division, before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and a special Jury. The trial excited great interest, the court being crowded at an early hour, and its approaches densely thronged. There was a large attendance of the members of the bar. The defendants were accommodated with seats in front of the bar, and the table before them was loaded with law books and legal documents, which both of them referred to from time to time. The Solicitor-General, Mr. Douglas Straight, and Mr. Mead appeared for the prosecution. The defendants conducted their own defence. A preliminary application to quash the indictment was refused, the point being reserved. The Solicitor-General then opened the case, referring to "The Confessional Unmasked" to show that it was not necessary that there should be an intention to vitiate public morals, supposing that such was the general effect of the book. His lordship said in that case they would be criminally liable. Formal evidence of the publication having been given, Mrs. Besant addressed the Court for her defence, leaving it to Mr. Bradlaugh to establish that a similar course had been taken by a large number of eminent writers She denied that the work was obscene, and argued that the information it conveyed was useful and necessary, and that opinion honestly expressed should not be pat down because some police agents did not agree with it. She denounced the prosecution as a disgrace to English justice. Mrs. Besant had not concluded when the Court rose. On Tuesday Mrs. Besant concluded her address to the jury, and was followed by the codefendant, who was still addressing the Court when the adjournment took place The Lard Chief Justice during the day admitted that the first chapter of the book, taken by itself, was perfectly honest and pure.
