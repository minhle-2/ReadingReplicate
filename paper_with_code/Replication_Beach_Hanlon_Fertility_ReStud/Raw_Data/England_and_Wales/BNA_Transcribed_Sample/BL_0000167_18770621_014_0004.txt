THE BRADLAUGH TRIAL.
	The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed yesterday. Mr. Bradlaugh continued his address, arguing that not one sentence in the pamphlet was directed against marriage, and that the subjects in question were discussed quite as fully, and less delicately in “Carpenter’s Physiology,” a book placed in the hands of boys and girls. The Lord Chief Justice interposed, observing that the Solicitor-General’s contention was that details essential in a medical book were unnecessary in a book for the public, and might have an evil tendency. Mr. Bradlaugh said the contention amounted to this, that a rich lady might obtain from her physician knowledge which it was criminal to communicate to the poor, to whom it was more essential. Miss Alice Vicary was then examined by Mrs. Besant, and deposed that she had examined the book, and considered it fit for general circulation. Dr. Drysdale said he did not consider there was anything prurient in the work. Mr. Bohn, the publisher of “Carpenter’s Physiology,” and other medical books, stated that he had never restricted their circulation. The case was then adjourned. The Lord Chief Justice will sum up today.
