THE BRADLAUGH-BESANT CASE.
	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant have determined to move to quash the Indictment, and Mrs. Besant will also move to enter judgment for the defendants, non obstante veredicto, on the ground that the verdict was really for them, as it expressly negatived any criminal intent. There will also be a motion made for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. For the last two motions it was necessary to enlarge the time, as they must be made within four days of the trial.
 	In the Queen’s Bench division, on Saturday, Mr. Bradlaugh in person applied to their lordships to extend the time for moving for a new trial in the prosecution of the Queen V. Bradlaugh and Besant until Thursday next, when he and his co-defendant are to come up for judgment.-Mr. Justice Mellor. We grant your application. You are quite entitled to it.
