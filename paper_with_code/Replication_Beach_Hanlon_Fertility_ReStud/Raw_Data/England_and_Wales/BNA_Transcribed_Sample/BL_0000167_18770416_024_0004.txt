PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH
	A meeting was held on Friday evening, at the Hall of Science, Old-street, in support of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, against whom a charge of publishing an alleged immoral book is pending. The chair was occupied by Mr. R. Forder. Mr. Paris moved, and Mr. Truelove seconded, a resolution, “That this meeting declares it is the duty of every good citizen to resist the present unjustifiable attempt at police censorship of the Press.” Mrs. Besant and Mr. Bradlaugh spoke in support of the motion. The former contended for a free Press for a free people, and no police censorship. As grown-up men and women, they claimed the right to think for themselves; denying the right of policemen to tell them what they should read. They did not publish the book because it was written by an eminent man of science, honoured and respected by all, and because if they stopped Knowlton (author of the work) to-day, they might stop Darwin and others tomorrow. Works dealing with kindred subjects were published at half a guinea, but theirs was sixpence. Their crime, in effect, was not publishing a medical work, but publishing it at sixpence, and so placing the knowledge it contained within the reach of those who wanted it the most. They were fighting not for themselves, but for the people. The resolution was unanimously carried, the remarks of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant being frequently interrupted by applause.
