“FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY.” ---- The trail of Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant in the Queen’s Bench Division of the High court Judicature, before the Lord Chief Justice and a special jury, closed on Thursday after a hearing of several days. In summing up, the Lord Chief Justice said more ill-advised, injudicious prosecution was never brought into a court of justice. The jury expressed their opinion that the book is calculated to deprave public morals, but exonerated the defendants from any corrupt motive in publishing it. By direction of the Lord Chief Justice a verdict of guilty was returned, and the defendants were permitted to leave on their own recognisances to be in attendance on Thursday next, when their motive in regard to the indictment will be heard and determined.
