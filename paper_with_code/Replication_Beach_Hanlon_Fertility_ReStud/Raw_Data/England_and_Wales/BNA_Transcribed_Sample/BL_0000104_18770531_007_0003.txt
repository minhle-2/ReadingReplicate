THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH.
	In the Queen’s Bench Division, on Wednesday morning (before Mr. Justice Mellor and Mr. Justice Lord), Mr. Bradlaugh, who was accompanied by Mrs. Besant, applied to have a day fixed for the trial of the indictment against himself and his co-defendant for the publication of a pamphlet called the “Fruits of Philosophy,” 
	Mr. Justice Mellor : We have considered the mode in which we should treat cases which have been removed into this court by certiorari, and we have come to the decision that they should be treated differently from ordinary cases, so as to prevent the proceedings by certiorari being reported to for the purpose of delay and of hanging up an indictment indefinitely. We think the present application reasonable, and we will consult the Lord Chief Justice, who will probably try the case himself, upon the matter, and will fix a day for the trial tomorrow. The case will not, however, be taken before the 12th of June.
