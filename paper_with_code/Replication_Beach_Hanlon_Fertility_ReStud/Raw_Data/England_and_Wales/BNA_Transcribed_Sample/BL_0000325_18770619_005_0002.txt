	The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for publishing an obscene book was commenced yesterday, in the Queen’s Bench. A preliminary application to quash the indictment was refused, the point being reserved. The Solicitor-General then opened the case, referring to the case of the “Confessional Unmasked” to show that it was not necessary that there should be an intention to vitiate public morals, supposing that such was the general effect of the book. Formal evidence of the publication having been given, Mrs. Besant addressed the Court for her defence. Leaving it to Mr. Bradlaugh to establish that similar ground had been taken by a large number of eminent writers, she denied that the work was obscene, arguing that the information it conveyed was useful and necessary, and that opinion honestly expressed should not be put down because some police agents did not agree with it. She denounced the prosecution as a disgrace to English justice. Mrs. Besant had not concluded when the Court rose.
