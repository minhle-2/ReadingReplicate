In the prosecution of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant the jury on Thursday found that the book upon which the proceedings were taken was calculated to debate public morals, but they exonerated the defendants from any corrupt motive in publishing it. A verdict of guilty was then entered, and the defendants were ordered to appear in the court that day week, when any objections they might have to make to the indictment would be considered.
