	THE BRADLAUGH-BESANT SENTENCE. --- Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant came up for sentence on Thursday, in the Court of Queen’s Bench. The Lord Chief Justice said that had the defendants, after the finding of the jury, undertaken not to circulate the book which had been condemned, the Court would have discharged them on their recognisances; but instead of doing that, they had since continued to sell the book and to defy the law, and their offence had assumed a very grave character. Each defendant was sentenced to be imprisoned for six months, to pay a fine of £200, and to enter into recognisances of £500 to be of good behavior for two years. Execution of judgment was stayed to enable the defendants to appeal, and they were liberated on bail.
