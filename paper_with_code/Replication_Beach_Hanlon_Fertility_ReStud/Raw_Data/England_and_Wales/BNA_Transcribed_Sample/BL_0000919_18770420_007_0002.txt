	The hearing of the charge against Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, of having published an obscene book, was concluded yesterday. Mr. Bradlaugh reserved his defence, but Mrs. Besant read a long statement, in the course of which she expressed a belief that it was better that children should not be born than that they should, after their birth, both killed by overcrowding, disease, and starvation. Both the defendants were committed for trial.
