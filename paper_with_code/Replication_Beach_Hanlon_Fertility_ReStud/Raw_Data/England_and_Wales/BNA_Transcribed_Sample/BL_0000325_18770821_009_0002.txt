	Mr. Bradlaugh, speaking at Bristol, last night, at a meeting called to form a branch of the Malthusian League, said that, although the sale of the “Fruits of Philosophy” used to be about 100 a year, since the prosecution of himself and Mrs. Besant over 130,000 copies had been sold. He stated that, if defeated in the Court of Error, he should carry the case to the Court of Appeal, and, if necessary, to the House of Lords; and if beaten there he would go to Holloway Gaol, and still continue to publish the book.
