Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant attended at the Guildhall police-court on Saturday, in order to protect themselves in the eyes of the public and the Court of Queen’s Bench from the consequences of being wrongly supposed to have broken their engagement to do nothing, either directly or indirectly to assist publication of the pamphlet called “Fruits of Philosophy,” which they have ascertained is being sold in their name. Sir Thomas Dakin said he thought it was a case for the police to take in hand, and Inspector Pitney undertook to report the matter to the Commissioners.
