     SENTENCE OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
       Judgment ma given by the Queen's Bench Division on Thursday in the case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, who had been convicted of publishing an indecent book. The application of the defendants for a new trial was refused, and an objection to the form of the indictment was over-ruled. The Lord Chief Justice, after consultation with Mr. Justice Mellor, remarked that had the defendants not defied the law by selling the pamphlet after the verdict, he would have discharged them upon their own recognisances; but as they had done so, he sentenced them to be imprisoned for six months, to pay a fine of £200 each to the Queen, and to enter into their own recognisance in £500 each to be of good behaviour for two years. The Lord Chief Justice emphatically denied the truth of Mrs. Besant’s statement that he had summed up in favour of the defendants both defendants, however, give notion of appeal, whereupon they were liberated on their on recognisances.
