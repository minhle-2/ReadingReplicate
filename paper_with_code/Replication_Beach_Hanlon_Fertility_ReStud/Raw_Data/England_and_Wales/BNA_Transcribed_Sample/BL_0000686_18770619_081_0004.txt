The Trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Anne Besant, for publishing an obscene book, was commenced yesterday in the Queen’s Bench. The Solicitor-General, Mr. Douglas Straight, and Mr. Mead prosecuted. A preliminary application to quash the indictment was refused, the point being reserved. The Solicitor General then opened the case. Formal evidence of the publication having been given, Mrs. Besant addressed the court for the defence, leaving it to Mr. Bradlaugh to establish that similar grounds had been taken by a large number of eminent writers. She denied that the work was obscene, argued that the information it conveyed was useful and necessary, and that opinions honestly expressed should not be put down because some police agents did not agree with them. Mrs. Besant had not concluded when the court rose.
