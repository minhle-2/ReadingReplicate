Mr. Bradlaugh, with Mrs. Besant, applied at the Queen’s Bench yesterday for a writ of certiorari to remove the trial for publishing “Fruits of Philosophy” from the Central Criminal Court to the Queen’s Bench. The Lord Chief Justice said they would read the book before deciding. It is the intention of Baron Grant to appeal.
