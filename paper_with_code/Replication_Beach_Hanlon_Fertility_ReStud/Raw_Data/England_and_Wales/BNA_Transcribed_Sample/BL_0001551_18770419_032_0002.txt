	Mr. Bradlaugh and his “literary partner.” Mrs. Annie Besant, are agitating Secularist London with great violence in order to obtain the money for a defence of Knowlton’s book on the “population question.” The pair of them are announced to speak at the Hall of Science tomorrow night, in order that they may prove how desirable it is that the people should be made acquainted with subjects which are generally left to philosophers. Of course, there will be a large, though not what the reporters call an influential, meeting.
