THE BRADLAUGH PROSECUTION
The Times holds that the plea of arresting the excessive increase of population ought not to be allowed to pass without more challenge than it has received from the Court and jury. Happily, the real truth is that the world is greater than one man on one opinion; and since we have to choose between Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant on the one hand, and certain reserves and proprieties surrounding the first laws of nature and the domestic hearth on the other. We are glad to find that this well-intentioned pair are not held to have established a right to dictate new rules of action and new conditions of existence to a reluctant and, as it feels, an insulted world. 
The Morning Post remarks that however little doubts we may entertain respecting the character of this pamphlet, and its deleterious effects on the public morals, some serious reflections arise on the legal interpretation put upon the finding of the jury. If the intent is to be gathered from the contents of a book and not from the conduct of the publisher, we fail to see what answer could be mad, by the latter if indicted for issuing many well-known works whose contents, every unprejudiced man would readily admit, were calculated to excite the passion and deprave the morals of those into whose hands they might happen to fall. 
The Standard observes that whatever good such a pamphlet might do, admitting for the sake of arguments that it could do any, there is at any rate no doubt that it would also do an infinite amount of harm, and this is just the consideration which, seems to have escaped the perception of Mrs. Besant and her co-defendant altogether.
