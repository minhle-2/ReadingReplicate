	A THRIVING TRADE – Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant spoke at Bristol at a meeting called by the Malthusian League on Tuesday. The proprietors of the Colston Hall refused to let either of their halls for the meeting, and it was held at the Hall of Freedom, situated in an outlying district of the city. Mr. Bradlaugh said that the sale of his pamphlet used to be about a hundred a year, but since the prosecution of himself and Mrs. Besant over 130,000 copies had been sold. He stated that he should carry the case, if necessary, to the House of Lords; and if beaten there he would go to Holloway gaol, and still continue to publish the book.
