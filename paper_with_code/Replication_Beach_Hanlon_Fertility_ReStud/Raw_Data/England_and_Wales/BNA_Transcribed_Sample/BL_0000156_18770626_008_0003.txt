LAW INTELLIGENCE

	THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT. The proceedings against Mrs. Besant and Mr. Charles Bradlaugh for having published a work The Fruits of Philosophy, calculated to deprave the public morals, were brought to a close on Thursday. The Solicitor-General having replied to the arguments brought forward by the defendants, the Lord Chief Justice summed up, and the Jury returned a verdict that the work is calculated to debase public morals, but entirely exonerating the defendants from any corrupt motives in publishing it. The Lord Chief Justice having directed that this should be taken as a verdict of guilty, both defendants were ordered to appear next Thursday for judgment. Mr. Bradlaugh applied in the Queen’s Bench Division on Saturday for an extension of the time for moving for a new trial in the recent prosecution until Thursday next, when he and Mrs. Besant are to come up for judgment. This was granted.
