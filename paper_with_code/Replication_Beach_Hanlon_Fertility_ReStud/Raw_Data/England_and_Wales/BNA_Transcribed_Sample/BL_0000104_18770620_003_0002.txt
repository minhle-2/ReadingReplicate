	In the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice on Tuesday, the trial of Mr. C. Bradlaugh and Mrs. A. Besant was resumed, and the latter continued her address, arguing that scientific checks on population were justifiable, and that the dissemination of such physical truth was not calculated to have a morally evil influence. Mr. Bradlaugh commenced his address, and had not concluded when the court rose.
