	Mr. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT. In the Queen’s Bench Division on Friday the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Mellor had before them a rule which had been obtained by Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, calling upon the prosecution to show cause why the judgment roll should not be completed by inserting the actual date when the interlocutory judgment was signed, why the time for the defendants to transcribe the judgment roll should not be enlarged, and why any further proceedings should not be stayed in the meantime. The Solicitor-General now showed caused against the rule, which was discharged by the Court, the Lord Chief Justice expressing his regret that the time of the Court, when there was so much important business to be disposed of, should have been taken up with such a trumpery application.
