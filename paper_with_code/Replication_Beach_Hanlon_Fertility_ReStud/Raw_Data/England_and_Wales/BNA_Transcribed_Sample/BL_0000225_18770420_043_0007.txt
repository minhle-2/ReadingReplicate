Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant, the editor and subeditor of the National Reformer, again appeared at the Guildhall Police-court on Tuesday on the charge of having published an indecent book. Mr. D. Straight appeared on behalf of the City authorities to prosecute, and after calling very little evidence, he asked that the defendants might be committed for trail. Another remand, however, became necessary, in consequence of the length of time occupied by Mr. Bradlaugh in endeavouring to establish his defence that the book was not obscene, and was published for a good purpose.
