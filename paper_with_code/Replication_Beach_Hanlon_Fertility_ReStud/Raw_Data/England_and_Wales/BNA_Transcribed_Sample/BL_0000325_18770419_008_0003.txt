THE TRIAL OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
	The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed today at Guildhall, women being absent from court. At the request of the prosecuting counsel and the defendant, the magistrate decided as to the admission of medical testimony regarding the character of the pamphlet, declaring it inadmissible. Mr. Bradlaugh then made a long speech in defence, comparing Knowlton’s pamphlet with other works, which, he declared, were worded far less delicately.
	Alderman Figgins, after half an hour’s adjournment, stated he should commit defendants for trial. Mr. Bradlaugh reserved his defence.
