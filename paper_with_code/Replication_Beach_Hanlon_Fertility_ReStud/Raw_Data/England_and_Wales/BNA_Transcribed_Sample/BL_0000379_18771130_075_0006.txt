DR. KENEALY’S MILLION SIXPENCES, -- The hon. Member for Stoke issued the following statement respecting his appeal made two months since for £23,000, in the shape of a “million sixpences:” I am sorry that this proposal, intended to rise an election fund for the release of Roger Tichborne, and the advancement of Magna Charta, is likely to be a failure. The enemy are crowing loudly. Be it so I have done my duty, and if the people will not do theirs I am powerless. Bradlaugh and Besant raised £1200 in few weeks. Little more than £20 has been sent to me, -- E.V. KENEALY.
