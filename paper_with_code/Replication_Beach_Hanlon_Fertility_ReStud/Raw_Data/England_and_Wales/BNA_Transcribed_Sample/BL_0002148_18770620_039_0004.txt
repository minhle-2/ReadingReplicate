       The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed yesterday in the Queen’s Bench. Mrs. Besant continued her address, arguing that as the natural checks in population, such as war. Famine, and disease were removed, it was necessary that scientific check. Should be substituted. Mrs. Besant was proceeding to treat of the Dar-winian doctrine of the survival of the fittest, when Lord Chief Justice Cockburn remarked it would be worthy Mr. Darwin's consideration, Whether the result of the struggle for existence was not twofold. namely, that beneath the small numbers of a highly gifted race, a deteriorated mass would yet be engendered.  Mrs. Besant having continued her arguments in the case was followed by Mr. Bradlaugh, who had not concluded his address when the Court rose. 
       Mr. Williams, constructor of the bridge at Bath, was examined at the Coroner's inquest yesterday, and stated his opinion formed from examining the structure after the accident, that the bridge had lost more than half its strength before it fell, He attributed this diminution of strength to the bows getting out of the perpendicular. The inquiry was adjourned.
