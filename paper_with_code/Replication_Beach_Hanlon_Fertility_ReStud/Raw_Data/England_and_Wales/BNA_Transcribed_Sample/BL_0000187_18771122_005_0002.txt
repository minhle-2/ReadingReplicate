	The case of Queen v. Bradlaugh and Besant came before the Queen’s Bench division on Saturday. The defendants urged that there had been some informalities and errors on the part of the prosecution, but the court decided that the proceedings were regular, and refused, with costs, the application of Mr. Bradlaugh for the amendment of the record.
