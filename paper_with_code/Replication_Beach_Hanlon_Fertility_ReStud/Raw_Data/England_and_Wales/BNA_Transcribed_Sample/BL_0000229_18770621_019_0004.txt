THE TRAIL OF MR. BRADLAGH AND MRS. BESANT
The trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed yesterday. Mr. Bradlaugh continued his address. He argued that the facts stated in the pamphlet were put in less delicate form in “Carpenter’s Physiology,” a book circulated by Government in boys and girls schools. The contention of the Solicitor- General amounted to this ---- That the rich lady might obtain the knowledge which it was criminal to communicate to the poor, who most needed it. Miss Alice Vicary, a medical student, and Dr. Drysdale gave evidence favourable to the book. Mr. Bohn, publisher, deposed that he never restricted the sale of “Carpenter’s Physiology,” and similar works. The Lord Chief Justice will sum up to-day.
