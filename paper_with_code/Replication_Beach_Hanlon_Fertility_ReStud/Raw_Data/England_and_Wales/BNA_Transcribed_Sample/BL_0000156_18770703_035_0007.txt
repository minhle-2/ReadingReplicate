	THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT – JUDGMENT – On Thursday judgment was given by the Queen’s Bench Division in the case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, who had been convicted of publishing an indecent book. The application of the defendants for a new trial was refused, and an objection to the form of the indictment was over-ruled. The Lord Chief Justice, after consultation with Mr. Justice Mellor, remarked that had the defendants not defied the law by selling the pamphlet after the verdict, he would have discharged them upon their own recognizances; but as they had done so, he sentenced them to be imprisoned for six months, to pay a fine of £200 each to the Queen, and to enter into their own recognizances in £500 each to be of good behavior for two years. Defendants were allowed out on bail, pending an appeal.
