The trial of Mr. Bradlaagh and Mrs. Besant was resumed yesterday. Mr. Bradlaugh, continuing his address, argued that the facts stated in the pamphlet were put in a lees delicate form in Carpenter's. Physiology, a book circulated by Government in boys' and girls' schools. The contention of the Solicitor-General amounted to this, that the rich lady might obtain the knowledge which it was criminal to communicate to the poor, who most needed it. Miss Alice Vicary, a medical student, and Dr. Drysdale gave evidence favourable to the book, and Mr. Bohn Publisher, deposed that he had never restricted the sale of Carpenter's Physiology, and similar works. The Lord Chief Justice will sum up to-day.
