THE POST-OFFICE AND MR. BRADLAUGH’S PAMPHALETS
Mr. P. Taylor gave notice that on Thursday, he will ask the Postmaster-General whether it was true that, during the last week, certain pamphlets written by Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant had been seized and detained in the Post-office as indecent and obscene.
