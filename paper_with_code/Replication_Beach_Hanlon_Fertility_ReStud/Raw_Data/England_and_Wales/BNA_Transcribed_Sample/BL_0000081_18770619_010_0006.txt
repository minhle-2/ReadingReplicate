	The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, for publishing an obscene book, “Fruits of Philosophy,” was commenced in the Queen’s Bench Division yesterday. A preliminary application to quash the indictment was refused, the point being reserved. The Solicitor-General having opened the case, Mrs. Besant addressed the court for the defence, and had not concluded when the court rose for the day.
