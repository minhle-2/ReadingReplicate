The Bradlaugh Case – Sentence
	Upon Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant coming up for judgment to-day Mr. Bradlaugh moved to quash the indictment on the ground that the words showing the obscenity of the book were not specified in the indictment.
	The defendants were bound over not to publish the book until the writ of error was decided. The Lord Chief Justice stated that defendants had acted straightforwardly during the trial. Affidavits were placed before the Lord Chief Justice before delivering judgment to-day that the sale of the pamphlet had been continued since the verdict of the jury had been given. Mr. Bradlaugh admitted this. The judge said the case had now assumed an aggravated character. The court had been prepared to discharge the defendants if they had obeyed the law; but, as they defied the law, they would be each imprisoned for six months, and pay £200 fine, execution stayed till the writ of error was decided.
