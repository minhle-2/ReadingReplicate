ARREST OF MR. BRADLAW. –Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, editor of the National Reformer, and Mrs. Annie Besant, the sub-editor, were brought up at the Guildhall Police-Court on Thursday, having been arrest; a charge of publishing a book alleged to be immoral. The work in question is a pamphlet by the late Charles Knowlton, M.D., entitled “Fruits of Philosophy,” and is sold by Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant at the Freethought Publishing Company’s premises at the price of sixpence. Alderman Figgins adjourned the case until the 17th inst., and admitted the defendants to bail in two sureties of £100 each, and themselves in £200 each. The co-defendant of the Liverpool Mercury says that Mrs. Besant, who was arrested with Mr. Bradlaugh has had an eventful life. The wife of a country parson, she commenced an energetic career by a very enthusiastic support of extreme High Church views. She published tracts and pamphlets intended to prove that Catholic truth was to be found only in the development of Anglicanism to its furthest point, But at last the great question of authority startled her; and instead of following Dr. Newman’s example and going over to Rome to stifle there the doubts which oppressed her, she parted from Christianity altogether, and quarreled with her husband, came to London as a Secularist lecturer. Beautiful and eloquent, she attracted large crowds to the Hall of Science, where Mr. and Mrs. Bradlaugh with their two daughters used to go to admire her feminine force and vigour. The friendship ripened into a “literary partnership;” and now they are charged together as misdemeanants.
