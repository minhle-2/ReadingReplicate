MR. BRADLAUGH AND THE HOUME OFFICE ---- Mr. Charles Bradlaugh writes, under date May 12th:--- “I am to-day officially informed from the secretary to the General Post-office that he claims the right to open, read and confiscate, without any intimation to myself, any works posted by me he may choose to consider illegal, and that during the past week he has seized the “Free-Thinker’s Text Book,” by Annie Besant, and the “Fruits of Philosophy,” by Dr. Knowlton. I can only appeal through the press and to Parliament against this monstrous course, and ask from your sense of justice publicity for my appeal.”
