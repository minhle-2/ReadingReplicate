MR. BRADLAUGH’S PAMPHLET AND THE POST-OFFICE.
	Lord JOHN MANNERS (North Leicester), in reply to Mr. P. A. Taylor (Leicester), stated that he was not aware that any pamphlets by Mr. Bradlaugh or Mrs. Besant had been detained at the post-office as indecent publications, but some copies of the “Fruits of Philosophy” had been detained as such under the 33rd and 34th Vict. The regulations under the Act were approved of by the Treasury in 1870, and, if desired, could be laid on the table.
