		THE BRADLAUGH – BESANT PROSECUTION
				HEAVY SENTENCE.
On Thursday, In the Queen’s Bench Division Mrs. Besant and Mr. Charles Bradlaugh came up for sentence for the offence of having published an obscene book of which they had been found guilty. An application to quash the indictment and a contention that the verdict of the jury was substantially one of not guilty having been heard affidavits were put in showing that the work had been sold since the verdict. The Lord Chief Justice observed that had the defendants admitted that they were in error and ready to abide by the law, the court was prepared to have allowed them to go at liberty on their own recognizance, but having set the law at defiance by continuing the publication. The offence had become a very grave one. The defendants were then each sentenced to be imprisoned for six calendar months, to pay a fine of £200, and to enter into recognisances of £500 each to be of good behaviour for two years – they have not goes to prison yet, as an appeal against the decision is to be made to the court of error. It may be some days before as opportunity occurs for the court to hear the arguments. If the case should be dismissed on the points raised the whole proceedings will fall to the ground. if the verdict is Queen’s Bench is sustained the lady and gentleman will be confined until the commencement of the new year as first class misdemeanants and also have to enter into an engagement not to publish the work for two years afterwards.
	The most offensive extracts from “the Priest in Absolution” have been printed and are selling largely in London the demand made for small pamphlets in even greater then it was for Mr. Bradlaugh’s publication.
