	The prosecution of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant came to a close on Thursday with a verdict that the book published by them was illegal, but that they had not been actuated by an improper motive in issuing it. As this, under the indictment, was equivalent to a verdict of guilty the defendants were directed to appear before the Court on Thursday for judgment.
