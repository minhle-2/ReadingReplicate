“THE FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY”
	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant attended before Sir Thomas Dakin, at the London Guildhall, on Saturday, to make a statement. Mr. Bradlaugh said that he and Mrs. Besant had been committed from that court for trial for publishing a book entitled “The Fruits of Philosophy,” and they were tried and convicted in the Court of Queen’s Bench, but, pending an appeal from that conviction, they were released on their own nominal recognisances, they pledging their words of honour that they would do nothing either directly or indirectly to assist the publication of the book, but, on the contrary, would do all in their power to suppress the sale of it. It had come to their knowledge that a firm in Ludgate-hill were sending out circulars stating that they were ready to supply a copy of the pamphlet for private circulation for selling the book having previously been sold at 6d. a copy. He went to these persons, and they assured him that they were not selling the book. He was not satisfied with that, but caused a registered letter to be sent from the country to them, asking for a copy of the pamphlet, and only two days ago he received a copy by post. He made that statement on behalf of Mrs. Besant and himself, so that it might be publicly known that they were in no way parties to the circulation of the book,-Sir Thomas Dakin said he presumed that Mr. Bradlaugh made this statement in the defence of himself and Mrs. Besant, to show that they had nothing to do with the circulation of the book.-Mr. Bradlaugh said that was precisely the case. They did not wish it to be believed that he and Mrs. Besant were taking advantage of their liberty to play fast and loose with the court that had shown them so much courtesy.-Sir Thomas Dakin said he thought it was a case which the police ought to take up, and look after the persons Mr. Bradlaugh had spoken of.-Inspector Pitney said he would report the case to the commissioners.
