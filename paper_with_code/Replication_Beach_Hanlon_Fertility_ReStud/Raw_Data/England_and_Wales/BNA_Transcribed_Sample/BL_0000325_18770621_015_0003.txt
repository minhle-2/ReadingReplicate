The Bradlaugh Case. 
	Mrs. Besant concluded her address to-day, stating that if the jury returned a verdict of guilty, history would say to her – well done! There was some applause in court at the conclusion. At the termination of Mr. Bradlaugh’s defence, the jury retired at a quarter to one and returned at twenty minutes to two. The jury found that book was calculated to deprave public morals, but exonerated defendants from corrupt motive. A verdict of guilty was accordingly entered. Sentence was deferred till this day week, when the reserved point will be discussed.
