The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for publishing an obscene book, was commenced before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in Queen's Bench yesterday. The Solicitor-General, Mr. Douglas Straight, and Mr. Mead prosecuted. A preliminary application to quash the indictment was refused, the point being reserved. The Solicitor-General then opened the case, referring to the prosecution in the instance of the " Confessional Unmasked' to show that It was not necessary that there should be intention to vitiate public morals, supposing that such was the general effect of the book. His Lordship said in that case they would be criminally liable. Formal, evidence of the publication having been given, Mrs. Besant addressed the Court for the defence, denying that the work was obscene, and argued that the Information it contained was useful and necessary. Mrs. Besant had not concluded when the Court rose. The defendants were cheered by a large crowd as they left Westminster Hall.
