     THE CHARGE AGAINST MR. BRADLAUGH
Mr. Bradlaugh, who, with Mrs. Besant, was a few days ago committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court by the Guildhall magistrate for publishing an obscene pamphlet, yesterday applied to the Queen's Bench Division for a writ of certiorari to remove the trial of the case into that division. The Court, after hearing the application, reserved their decision, taking time in order to read the pamphlet, the publication of which formed the basis of the prosecution.
