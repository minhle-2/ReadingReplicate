	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant, two well-known free thought advocates, were yesterday morning arrested on the charge of publishing an immoral work entitled “Fruits of Philosophy: an Essay on the Publication Question.” Subsequently, while before Mr. Alderman Figgins at the London Guildhall police-court, sufficient evidence to justify a remand was taken, and the prisoners were liberated on bail. Mr. Bradlaugh, who was not represented by counsel, stated that the present was only a test case, in connection with which he intended to call some 40 witnesses.
