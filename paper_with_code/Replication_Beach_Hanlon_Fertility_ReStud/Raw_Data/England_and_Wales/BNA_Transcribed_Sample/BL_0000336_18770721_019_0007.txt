Recently Dr. Kenealy wrote the following letter to Mrs. Besant:—"Madam„—I have read a printed letter signed with your name, and published to all the world, in which you use the following word' with reference to Chief Justice Cockburn and myself: — ‘I remembered the wicked slanders Dr. Kenealy had Heaped upon him (the Lord Chief Justice), and knew that those slander had circulated amongst many of those whom I addressed.' Allow me to ask, what are the slanders to which you refer? -- I am, madam, your humble servant, E. V. KENEALY"—to this Mrs. Besant replied as follows:—"Sir,—in my article in the National Reformer, to which you refer, I alluded to slanders uttered in the Englishman, a journal 'edited by Kenealy.' If you are the Kenealy who edits that paper, and will write to me to that effect, I will reply to your question at once. Otherwise I do not know how the matter concerns you.—your obedient servant, ANNE BESANT."
