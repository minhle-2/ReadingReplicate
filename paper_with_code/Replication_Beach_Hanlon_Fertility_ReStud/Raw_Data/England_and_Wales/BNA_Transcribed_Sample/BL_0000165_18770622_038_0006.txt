The trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for publishing an alleged obscene book, “The fruits of Philosophy,” was commenced in the Queen’s Bench Division on Monday. A preliminary application to quash the indictment was refused, the point being reserved. The Solicitor-General having opened the case, Mrs. Besant addressed the Court for the defence, in a speech lasting nearly two days, when Mr. Bradlaugh proceeded with his defence.
