	Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant appeared before Sir Thomas Dakin at the Guildhall on Saturday in order to protect themselves in the eyes of the public and the Court of Queen’s Bench. Mr. Bradlaugh complained that a firm on Ludgate-hill were sending out circulars stating that they would supply a copy of “The Fruits of Philosophy” for private circulation for 3a, the book being previously sold for 6d. He went to them, and he was told they were not selling the book, but applying from the country for one a copy was duly sent. He and Mrs. Besant wished it publicly known that they were not parties to that nefarious circulation. The magistrate called the attention of the police to the matter.
