ARREST OF MR. BRADLAUGH
	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, the well known “Free Thought” advocates, were arrested by Detective-sergeant Outram and Detectives Williams and Simmonds, of the City police, on a charge of printing and publishing a pamphlet of an alleged immoral character. The title of the work in question is “The Fruits of Philosophy,” and it may be remembered that a few weeks since Mr. Charles Watts, publisher, of 84, Fleet street, was indicted at the Old Bailey Sessions for issuing the same work, and he in consequence stopped its publication, besides paying the costs of the prosecution. Mr. Bradlaugh being dissatisfied with this result, and holding the opinion that as the subjects dealt with in the book were treated upon from a medical point of view, its contents were not objectionable, determined to re-issue the work at his own office, the Free Thought Publishing Company, 28, Stone cutter street, and contest any proceedings that might be taken on that ground. When the new edition was issued Mr. Bradlaugh, it is stated, personally deposited a copy each with Mr. Martin, the chief clerk of the Guildhall Police-court, and the principal officer of the City police detective department, and mentioned that in the event of proceedings being taken, he had no intention of evading the issue, and if arrested he hoped they would subject him to as little inconvenience as possible. The warrant, which is made out under Lord Campbell’s Act, was granted at the instance of the Solicitor to the Treasury, and it is said to have been in the hands of the police authorities for nearly a week before the prosecution definitively decided upon the advisability of putting it into execution. The book which in the subject of the prosecution, was, is it said, sold unchallenged for several years.
