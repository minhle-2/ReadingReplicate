MRS. BESANT. — A London correspondent says that Mrs. Besant, who was arrested with Mr. Bradlaugh, has had an evenful life. The wife of a country parson, she commenced an energetic career by a very enthusiastic support of extreme High Church views. She published tracts and pamphlets intended to prove that Catholic truth was to be found only in the development of Anglicanism to its furthest point. But at last the great question of authority startled her; and instead of following Dr. Newman’s example and going over to Rome to stifle than the doubts which oppressed her, she parted from Christianity altogether, and, quarrelling with her husband, came to London as a Secularist lecturer. Beautiful and eloquent, she attracted large crowds to the Hall of Science, where Mr. and Mrs. Bradlaugh with their two daughters used to go to admire her feminine force and vigour. The friendship ripened into a "literary partnership;” and now they are charged together as misdemeanants.
