THE CHARGE AGAINST MR BRADLAUGH
	Mr. Bradlaugh applied to the Queen’s Bench for a division on behalf of himself and Mrs. Besant today (Friday), that any indictment which might be found against them should be removed to that court, and tried by a special jury, on the ground of the prejudice which had been excited. The Lord Chief Justice said they would examine the book and give their decision.
