		THE CONVICTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
       The Lord Chief  Justice and Mr. Justice Mellor had before them yesterday (Friday), in the Queen’s Bench Division, the case of the Queen V. Bradlaugh and Besant. The defendants had obtained a rule calling upon the prosecution to show cause why the Judgment roll herein should not be completed by inserting the actual date when the interlocutory Judgment was signed on the postes and why the time, of the defendants to transcribe the said Judgment roll should not be enlarged, and why any further proceedings should not be stayed in the meantime.
 The Solicitor-General, with whom was Mr. Mead, showed cause against the rude. He was not aware of any precedent for the application which the rule involved. The Judgment in this case was in its form regular, and was a recorded Judgment. Their Lordship had absolute power over all judgments in their court, and it would, therefore be rash to say that they had no power to alter a recorded Judgment.
 Mrs. Besant and Mr. Bradlaugh urged that there had been an informality in not signing the rule to arrest Judgment, and that before they could proceed further on writ of error it was necessary that the record should be corrected. The arguments were peculiarly technical.
 The court held that the proceedings were regular and discharged the rule with costs.
