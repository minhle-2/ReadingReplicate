	DR. KENEALY AND THE PEOPLE. Dr. Kenealy has given us a great shock. He confesses failure. He is “powerless” unless the people do their duty, and they have emphatically declined to do so. The Member for Stoke asked for a million sixpences to make up an election fund of £15,000, to be employed in returning members to Parliament pledged to the cause of the Claimant and the advancement of Magna Charta. The Doctor sought £15,000, “the people” have given him £20! This is very hard. No wonder Dr. Kenealy feels sore, especially when we reflect, as the Member for Stoke somewhat contemptuously reminds us, “Bradlaugh and Besant raised £1200 in a few weeks.” – Echo.
