MR. BRADLAUGH’S CASE
	Mr. Bradlaugh applied to the Queen’s Bench, on Wednesday, to fix a day for the trial of himself and Mrs. Besant. The court agreed to fix the earliest day after the 12th of June, when the Lord Chief Justice can preside.
	On Thursday, the Solicitor-General applied in the Queen’s Bench Division, to call attention to the sale of Mr. Bradlaugh’s book, which might be doing serious injury to thousands. Their Lordships said they could not do anything, as the matter was sub judice, but the Lord Chief Justice would be prepared to hear it on the 18th June, and if the Crown was successful, the conduct of Mr. Bradlaugh would be considered in reference to the sale of the book.
