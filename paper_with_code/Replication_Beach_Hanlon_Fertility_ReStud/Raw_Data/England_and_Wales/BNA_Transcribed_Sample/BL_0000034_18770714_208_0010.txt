Mrs. Besant—Old Cheltonians will probably have pondered over the name of Besant when they heard it mentioned in connexion with a recent prosecution. Mrs. Besant’s husband was at one time a house-master at Cheltenham, and was subsequently appointed to a living near Boston. Here a separation took place, caused, as it was then stated, by the peculiar views held by the lady. Mrs. Besant came to London, and after a period of uncertain hovering between Unitarians and Agnostic doctrines, published a pamphlet entitled “My Road to Atheism.” This fell into the hands of Mr. Bradlaugh who subsequently engaged the lady as sub-editor of the National Reformer.—Whitehall Review.
