	THE BRADLAUGH PROSECUTION. At the Central Criminal Court, London, on Monday, the Recorder in his charge referred to the indictment against Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, pointing out that even a laudable object would not be a good defence if the book were really obscene. The jury returned a true bill in the case.
