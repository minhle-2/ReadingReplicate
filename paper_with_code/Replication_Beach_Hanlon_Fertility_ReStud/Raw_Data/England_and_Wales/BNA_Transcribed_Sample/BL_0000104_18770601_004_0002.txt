	Mr. Bradlaugh was on Thursday informed, in the Court of Queen’s Bench, that the case against him for publishing, jointly with Mrs. Besant, an alleged indecent book, would be tried on the 18th inst. The Solicitor-General, who subsequently attended the court, mentioned that the prosecution was exceedingly anxious that the case should be decided as early as possible.
