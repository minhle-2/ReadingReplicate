THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGHAND MRS.BESANT
Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant have determined to move to quash the indictment, and Mrs. Besant will also move to enter judgment for the defendants, non obstante verdict, on the ground that the verdict was really intent. There will also be a motion made for new trail, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. For the last two motions it was necessary to enlarge the time, as they must be made within four days of the trail.
In the Queen’s Bench Division on Saturday,
Mr. Bradlaugh in person applied to their lordships to extend the time for moving for a new trail in the prosecution of the Queen v. Bradlaugh and Besant until Thursday next, when he and his co-defendant are to come up for judgment.
Mr. Justice Mellor: We grant your application. You are quite entitled to it.
