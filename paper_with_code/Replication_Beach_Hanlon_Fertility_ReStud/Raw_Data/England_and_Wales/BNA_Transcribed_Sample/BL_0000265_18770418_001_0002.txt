The case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was heard at Guildhall yesterday. The Charge was for selling an obscene book. The defendants claim a right to sell. Mr. Alderman Figgins wanted the numerous ladies present to quit the Court, but to his deep sorrow they would not. We remember a trial in Brussels where the ladies refusing to turn out were started in this fashion. The Judge exclaimed to the hesitating counsel, “You can proceed, sir, all the modest women have left the Court.”  This observation effected a stampede of the ladies in the Belgian case: but it would not have scared the fair visitors of London Guildhall, who probably pleaded “scientific reasons” for stopping to hear the case.
