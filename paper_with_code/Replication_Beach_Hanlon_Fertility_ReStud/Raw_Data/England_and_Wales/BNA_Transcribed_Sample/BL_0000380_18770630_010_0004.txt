SENTENCE ON MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant came up for sentence to-day. As the sale of the pamphlet “Fruits of Philosphy” had been continued with the defendants connivance since the verdict, the lord chief justice said the case had assumed an aggravated character. The court had been prepared to discharge the defendants if they had obeyed the law, but as they defied the law they would be each imprisoned for six months and pay £200 fine. Execution was stayed until a write or error be decided.
