THE BRADLAUGH PROSECUTION
       The prosecution of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besent was resumed yesterday, at Guildhall, London. Alderman Figgins refused to admit opinions of medical witnesses that the book in question was unobjectionable. Mr. Bradlaugh proceeded to compare the incriminated passages with others in the works of Dr. Carpenter, and with books to be found on all bookstalls. The court adjourned for a short time to allow Mrs. Besant to prepare her address, should the case be sent for trial. Alderman Figgins, after half an hour’s adjournment, stated he should commit the defendants for trial. Mr. Bradlaugh reserved his defence, but Mrs. Besant read a long statement, recording her conviction that the fact of over-population ought to be recognized. She believed it better to prevent the over-conception of children than to murder them after birth by overcrowding, disease and starvation. The defendants were then formally committed.
