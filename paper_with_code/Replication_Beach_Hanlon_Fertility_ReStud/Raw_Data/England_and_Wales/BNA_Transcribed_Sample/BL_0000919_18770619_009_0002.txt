	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant were charged at Westminster, yesterday, with publishing an indecent book. Previous to the jury being sworn Mr. Bradlaugh moved to quash the indictment, in consequence of defect on the face of it. The Lord Chief Justice reserved his decision on the point. The case for the prosecution having been completed, Mrs. Besant addressed the Court at some length, and had not finished when the court rose.
