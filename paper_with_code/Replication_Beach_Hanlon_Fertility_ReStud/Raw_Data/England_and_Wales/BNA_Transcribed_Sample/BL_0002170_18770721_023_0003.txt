THE “FRUITS OF PHILOSPHY”
Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant attended before Sir Thomas Dakin at Guildhall Police-court, in order to protect themselves in the eyes of the public and the court of Queen’s Bench. Mr. Bradlaugh said that he and Mrs. Besant had been committed from that court of Queen’s Bench, but pending an appeal from the conviction, they were let out on their own nominal recognizances, they pledging their words of honour to do nothing either directly or indirectly to assist the publication of the book, but on the contrary, to do all in their power to suppress the sale of it. It had come to their knowledge that Messrs. Martin, Boundy and Co., of 30 Ludgate hill, were sending out circulars stating that they were ready to supply a copy of the pamphlet for private circulation for 3., the book having been previously sold at 6d. a copy. He went to them and they assured him they were not selling it. He was not satisfied with the explanation, but caused a registered letter to be sent from the country to them, asking a copy of the book, and only two days ago he got the book sent back by the post. He made the statement on behalf of Mrs. Besant and himself, so that it might be publically known that they were in no way parties to the nefarious circulation. Sir Thomas Dakin Said he presumed that Mr. Bradlaugh made this statement in defense of himself and Mrs. Besant, to show that they had nothing to do with the circulation. Mr. Bradlaugh said that he was precisely the case. They did not wish it to be believed that he and Mrs. Besant were taking advantage of their liberty and to play fast and loose with the court that had shown them so much courtesy. Sir Thomas Dakin said he thought it was a case which the police ought to take up, and look after those parties. Inspector Pitney said he would report the case the commissioner. Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant thanked Sir Thomas Dakin for his courtesy, and retired.
