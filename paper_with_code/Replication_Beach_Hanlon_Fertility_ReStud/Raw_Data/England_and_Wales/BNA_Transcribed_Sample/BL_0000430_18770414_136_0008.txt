	The news of the arrest of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant has by this time furnished a topic of discussion to persons other than those who are directly interested in a defence of the pamphlet, the production of which has ………….the two Freethinkers the distinction of a public appearance before Alderman Figgins. It would obviously be improper to discuss in any manner the merits of the charge against. “Iconoclast” and “Ajax.” A matter of fact, however, I may mention that the delay which occurred between the commission of the offence (of offenders) and the arrest was owing to the time consumed in consultations between the City authorities and the Home Office. In the result, Mr. Cross agreed to prosecute on the part of the Government. A defence fund has been opened, and a defence Committee organized. On the latter we find a physician, a master and bachelor of arts, a female member of the London School Board, and a group of people who hail from the provinces. Mr. Bradlaugh will himself conduct his defence and that of his fellow-martyr.
