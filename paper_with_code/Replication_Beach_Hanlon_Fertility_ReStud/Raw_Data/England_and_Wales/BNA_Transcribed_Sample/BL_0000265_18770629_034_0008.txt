THE CHARGE AGAINST MR. BRADLAUGH.
In the Queen’s Bench Division today the Solicitor-General prayed for judgment in the case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. Mr. Bradlaugh moved to quash the indictment on the ground that he did not set forth specifically the words charged as obscene. Mrs. Besant argued that the findings of the jury was really a verdict of not guilty, inasmuch as they acquitted the defendants of any corrupt intentions. His Lordship said that she was wrong in her law. If a person did an unlawful act he must abide by it, whether his motive. The jury had found that the book was obscene, and it was the duty of every good citizen not to set himself above the law to do what he considered a good thing. The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said the case was peculiarly for the jury, and there should be no new trial on any of the grounds alleged. The Solicitor-General put his affidavit showing sale of the work since the verdict. Conversation with Justice Meller, his Lordship said, had the defendants announced in court having acted in error as the jury found they did, and that they were ready to submit to the law, the Court was prepared to have allowed them to go at liberty on their own recognisances; but instead of this they had since the verdict set the law at defiance by continuing the publication. . The offence now assumed a very grave character. The sentence was that they be each imprisoned for six months, pay a fine of £200, and enter in to recongnisances in £500, to be of good behavior for two years. On the application of the defendants, execution was stayed to enable them to appeal, they undertaking to cease the publication of the work meanwhile.
