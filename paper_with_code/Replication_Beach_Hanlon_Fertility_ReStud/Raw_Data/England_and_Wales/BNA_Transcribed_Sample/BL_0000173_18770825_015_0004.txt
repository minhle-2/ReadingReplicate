Mr. Bradlaugh, speaking at Bristol on Monday, said although the sale of “The Fruits of Philosophy” used to be about 100 a year, since the prosecution of himself and Mrs. Besant, over a hundred and thirty thousand copies had been sold. If defeated in the Court of Error, he should carry the case to the Court of Appeal, and if necessary to the House of Lords, and if beaten there, he would go to Holloway Gaol, and still continue to publish the book.
