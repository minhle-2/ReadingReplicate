“THE FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY.” Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant attended the Guildhall Police Court on Saturday, in order to protect themselves in the eyes of the public, and the Court of Queen’s Bench from consequences of being wrongly supposed to have broken their engagement to do nothing, either directly or indirectly, to assist the publication of the pamphlet called “Fruits of Philosophy,” which they have ascertained is being sold in their name. Sir Thomas Dakin said he thought it was a case for the police to take in hand, and Inspector Putney undertook to report the matter to Commissioner.
