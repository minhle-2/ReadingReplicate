THE CHARGE AGAINST MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT
IMPORTANT APPLICATION

	Yesterday, in the Court of Queen’s Bench, Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant appeared in person, and applied for a certiorari to remove any indictment that might be found against them in the Queen’s Bench Division, to be tried by a special jury, on the ground that a common jury of the Central Criminal Court might be influenced by newspapers, some of which said they ought to be convicted whether their case came within the statute or not, and that they ought to be punished with hard labour. He wished to show that the alleged obscene publication was a scientific treatise. The Lord Chief Justice said Mr. Justice Mellor and himself would look over the book and give their decision as to coming before a special jury by the nature of the book, and whether it had a legitimate object in view or was only calculated to raise the passions of those who read it. The decision was reserved accordingly.
