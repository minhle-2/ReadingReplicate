The hearing of the charge against Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for selling an immoral book, was resumed at the Guildhall, London, yesterday. At the request of the prosecuting counsel the magistrate decided as to the admission of medical testimony regarding the character of pamphlet, and declared it was inadmissable. Mr. Bradlaugh then made a long speech in his defence, comparing Knowllton’s pamphlet, with other works, which he declared were worded far less delicately. Mrs. Besant read a long statement given the history of the pamphlet, and recorded her conviction that the fact of over-population ought to be recognised. She believed it better to prevent over-conception of children than to murder them after birth by disease and starvation. The defendants were then formally committed.
