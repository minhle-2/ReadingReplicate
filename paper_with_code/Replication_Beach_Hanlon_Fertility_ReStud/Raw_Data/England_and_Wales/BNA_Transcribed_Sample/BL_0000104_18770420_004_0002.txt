	The enterprise of some of the illustrated papers is truly gratifying. At least two of them publish portraits of Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant, the defendants in the “Fruits of Philosophy” case. As I steadfastly gazed on the lace labelled “Mr. Bradlaugh.” I felt assured that I had seen it before. Suddenly the well-springs of my memory were let loose, and I recollected all. As you know, a charming illustration is published by Messrs. Cassell, showing the various stages through which a human being passes in his journey from childhood to honoured or dishonoured old age. In this case, the face chosen for that of Mr. Bradlaugh was that of the amiable old gentleman who occupies the place of honour in the right hand upper corner of the picture. In Mrs. Besant’s portrait I recognized an old friend – no other than Mrs. Bravo.
