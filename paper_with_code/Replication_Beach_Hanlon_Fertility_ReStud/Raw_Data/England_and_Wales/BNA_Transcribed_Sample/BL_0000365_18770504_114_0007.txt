THE PROSECUTION OF MR BRADLAUGH, -- Mr.  Bradlaugh on Friday applied to the Queen’s Bench that the indictment against him and Mrs. Besent, for publishing an obscene book, might be tried in that court, before a special jury, and not at the Central Criminal Court.—After hearing all his reason, the Lord Chief Justice said:—“The fate of this application must depend upon the real and true nature of this work. If, upon locking at it, we think that its object is the legitimate one of promoting knowledge upon a matter of public interest then we should be inolined to prevent the occurrence of a miscarriage of a justice by allowing the case to be tried before a special jury. If, on the other hand, we think that the scientific character attributed to the work is a more pretence and cover for indecency, we shall allow the ordinary procedure to prevail, and the case must be tried in the Central Criminal Court in due course”—On Monday (after reading the book), the Lord Chief Justice said: __ “We have  looked at the work, and we think there is a fair question for consideration whether the book is a scientific production for legitimate scientific purpose, or whether it is what the indictment states it to be, an obscene publication. We think it is a question that requires to be tried by a judge and a special jury, therefore a certiorari will be issued for the removal of the indictment into this Bench."
