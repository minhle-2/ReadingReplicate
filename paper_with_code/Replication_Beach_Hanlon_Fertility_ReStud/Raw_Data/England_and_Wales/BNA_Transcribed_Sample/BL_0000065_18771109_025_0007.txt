THE BRADLAUGH-BESANT CASE.
	In the Queen’s Bench, last week, Mr. Bradlaugh, accompanied by Mrs. Besant, applied for a rule calling on the prosecution to show cause why the judgment roll in the recent prosecution should not be amended in a number of technical points. The Lord Chief Justice, while observing that the points raised appeared to him mere cobwebs, granted the rule. In the same court, Alfred Thomas Wilson, charged under the Extradition Treaty with extensive robbery of bonds in Switzerland, was discharged, on the ground that he was a British subject.
