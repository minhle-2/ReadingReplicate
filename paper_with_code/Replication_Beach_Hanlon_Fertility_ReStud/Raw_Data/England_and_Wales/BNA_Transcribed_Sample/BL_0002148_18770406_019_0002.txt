Mr. Charles Bradlaugh the well-known lecturer. And Mrs. Annie Besant, the “Free Thought” advocate, were yesterday morning arrested by city detectives on charge of printing and publishing a pamphlet which, it is alleged, is of an immoral character. They were brought up at the Guildhall Police-court, London, yesterday afternoon. The case is likely to prove of a sensational character. Mr. Bradlaugh assorts his right to publish books entitled “The Fruits of Philosophy” &c.
