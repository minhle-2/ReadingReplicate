THE TRAIL OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT
The court of Queen’s Bench, yesterday, fixed the 18th instant for the trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, and intimated that, should the Crown be successful, the fact of the pamphlet having been sold while the case was sub judice would be taken into consideration.
