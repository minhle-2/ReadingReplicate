	It will have been noticed that Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, in this summing up on the Bradlaugh – Besant case, expressed his very strong regret that the prosecution had been undertaken. I have reason to know that this regret was shared by Mr. Cross, who displayed his usual sound sense in arguing against the proceedings, but he was unable to help himself.
