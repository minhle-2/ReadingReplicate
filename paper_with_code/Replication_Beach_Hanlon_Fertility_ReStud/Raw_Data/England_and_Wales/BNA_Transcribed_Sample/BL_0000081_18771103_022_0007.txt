THE BRADLAUGH – BESANT CASE
___
In the Queen’s bench, yesterday, Mr. Bradlaugh, accompanied by Mrs. Besant, moved for a rule calling on the prosecution in the recent case to show cause why they should not complete the judgment roll in a number of technical particulars. – The Lord Chief Justice said his impression was that these objections were mere cob webs; but, if it should turn out that there had been any irregularity the whole thing could be done over again after the verdict. – Rule granted accordingly.
