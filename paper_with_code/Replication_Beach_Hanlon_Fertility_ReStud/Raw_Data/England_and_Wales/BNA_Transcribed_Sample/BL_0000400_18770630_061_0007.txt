THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
	Mr. Bradlaugh applied in the Queen’s Bench Division on Saturday for an extension of the time for moving for a new trial in the above prosecution until Thursday, when he and his co-defendant, Mrs. Besant, were to come up for judgment. Mr. Justice Mellor said: We grant your application. You are quite entitled to it. Mrs. Besant and Mr. Bradlaugh spoke on Sunday night at the New Hall of Science, Old-street, on the subject of their prosecution. Mrs. Besant expressed her satisfaction at the summing up of the Lord Chief Justice, and Mr. Bradlaugh promised his hearers to carry the case to the House of Lords if necessary.
