	THE BRADLAUGH PROSECUTION – In the Queen’s Bench Division, before Mr. Justice Mellor and Mr. Justice Lush, Mr. Bradlaugh, who was accompanied by Mrs. Besant, applied to have day fixed for the trial of the indictment against himself and his co-defendant for the publication of a pamphlet called the “Fruits of Philosophy.” Mr. Justice Mellor; We have considered the mode in which we should treat cases which have been removed into this court by certiorari, and we have come to the decision that they should be treated differently from ordinary cases, so as to prevent the proceeding by certiorari being reported to for the purpose of delay and hanging up an indictment indefinitely. We think the present application reasonable and we will consult the Lord Chief Justice, who will probably try the case himself, upon the matter, and will fix a day for the trial. The case will not, however, be taken before the 12ht of June.
