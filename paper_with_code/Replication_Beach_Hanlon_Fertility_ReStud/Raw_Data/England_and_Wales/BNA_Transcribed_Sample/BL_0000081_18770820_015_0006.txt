	Colonel Makins has given great offence to Mr. Bradlaugh. A petition from certain persons in Essex, complaining of the recent prosecution of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, was entrusted to the honourable gentlemen to present to the House of Commons, and he declined to present it on the ground that he did not agree with it-a wholly inadequate reason, by the way, as member constantly present petitions with which they do not agree. During the present week Mr. Bradlaugh and his companion have been fighting in the law courts-that is to say, in the chambers of the vacation judge, Sir Henry Lopes-Sundry technical points arising out of their trial. They have gone to Plymouth, and are to hold forth tomorrow. Sunday is the day for verifying the old adage about as many minds to many opinions. While Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant will be expounding the Fruits of Philosophy in Plymouth, Cardinal. Manning will be consecrating a new church in your neighborhood, and Mr. Haweis will be preaching in London on (I quote from his advertisement) “Every man a penny.”
