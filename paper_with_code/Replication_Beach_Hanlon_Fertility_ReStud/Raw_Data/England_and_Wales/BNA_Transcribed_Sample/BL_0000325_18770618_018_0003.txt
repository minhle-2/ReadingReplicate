The Bradlaugh Case.
	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant were indicted at Westminster today for publishing an indecent book. Before the jury were sworn Mr. Bradlaugh said he had a motion to quash the indictment. The Lord Chief Justice said he could not hear motions then. Mr. Bradlaugh contended that a motion might be made before the jury were sworn, and he moved to quash the indictment for defect on the face of it. The Lord Chief Justice reserved the point.
