“Act ---- set in the living present.” Since laying down our pen, we have learnt the sentence pronounced on Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, though their motives were recognised pure. If they are justly dealt with, what should be done respecting the book to which reference has been made? A sense of justice will never allow the matter to rest; a demand for searching inquiry and decided action will be echoed from every quarter ---- a demand which must be satisfied, for the honour of our church and nation, aye of our common humanity.
