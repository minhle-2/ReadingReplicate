The Solicitor-General, Mr. Douglas Straight, and Mr. Mead prosecuted. A preliminary application to quash the indictment was refused the point being reserved. The Solicitor-General then opened the case Formal evidence of the publication having been given; Mrs. Besant addressed the court for the defiance, leaving it to Mr. Bradlaugh to establish that similar grounds had been taken by a large number of eminent writers. She denied that the work was obscene, argued that the information it conveyed was useful and necessary, and that opinions honestly expressed should not be putdown because some police agents did not agree with them. At the conclusion of Mrs. Besant’s address, Mr. Bradlaugh rose to address the Jury. He stated that this book could not be considered obscene according the Lord Campbell’s definition of his own act. The (UNREADABLE TEXT) Lord had said it was intended to apply exclusively to works written for the (UNREADABLE TEXT) purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and calculated to a check the nations of (UNREADABLE TEXT).

Mr. Bradlaugh concluded his address on Wednesday, after which (UNREADABLE TEXT) witnesses were called for the defiance. The case was again adjourned.
