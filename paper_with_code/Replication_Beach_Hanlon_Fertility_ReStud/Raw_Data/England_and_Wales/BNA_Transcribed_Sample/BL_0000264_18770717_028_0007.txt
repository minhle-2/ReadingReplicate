“THE FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY.”
At the London Guildhall on Saturday, Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant attended before Sir Thomas Dakin in order to protect themselves in the eyes of the public and the Court of Queen’s Bench. Mr. Bradlaugh said that he and Mrs. Besant had been committed from this court for trial. They were tried and convicted in the Court of Queen’s Bench, but pending an appeal from that conviction they were let out on their own nominal recognisances, they pledging their words of honour that they would do nothing either directly or indirectly to assist the publication of the book – on the contrary, would do all in their power to suppress the sale of it. It had come to their knowledge that Messrs Martin, Boundy, and Co., of 30, Ludgate Hill, were sending out circulars stating that they were ready to supply a copy of the pamphlet for private circulation for 3s, the book having been previously sold at 6d a copy. He went to them, and they assured him that they were not selling it. Not satisfied with that, he caused a registered letter to be sent from the country to them for a copy of the book, and only two days ago he received by post what he asked for. He made that statement on behalf of Mrs. Besant and himself, so that it might be publicly known that they were in no way parties to that nefarious circulation. Sir Thos. Dakin said he presumed Mr. Bradlaugh made this statement in defence of himself and Mrs. Besant to show that they had nothing to do with the circulation. Mr. Bradlaugh said that was precisely the case. They did not wish it to be believed that he and Mrs. Besant were taking advantage of their liberty to play fast and loose with the Court that had shown them so much courtesy. Sir Thomas Dakin said he thought it was a case which the police ought to take up, and Inspector Pitney said he would report the case to the Commissioners.
