	A meeting was held on Friday evening, in the Hall of Science in Old-street, to support Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant in defending the prosecution brought against them for selling a book alleged to be immoral. Both the accused persons addressed the meeting. Mr. Bradlaugh declared that he would fight the case if necessary in every court of the kingdom. He was confident of a verdict in his favour, and it was very likely that when he got it he would discontinue selling the book complained of, though he would not give any pledge to do so.
