You see the verdict in the case of Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. The sentence, it is said, will probably be a fine of £100 and a week’s imprisonment; but the general expression in that the verdict cannot stand. I have not seen the pamphlet, and have no wish to see it; but it is the work of a medical man of position and skill, and it is preposterous to say that it is calculated to deprave public morals when it is sold in the streets at 6d. although it might be sold at 2s, 6d, or 10s. 6d. with impunity. If this prosecution had not been instituted the book would never have been heard of out of Messrs. Churchill’s shop; but it is now selling all over the country, and you may buy it in any of the streets of London, and will continue to be able to buy it, I believe. The circulation has been increased by this trail from 100 a year to 120,000 and Mr. Bradlaugh, it is said, sets 2d upon every copy, that is to say, the prosecution puts £1,000 into his pocket in order to suppress the publication! Bradlaugh’s address to the jury was very powerful, for the man is a born orator, has a fine voice, and knows how to talk; but Mrs. Besant’s was the clever and telling speech. Everyone listened to it with pleasure, the points were well selected and were made, and the tone manner of the woman was those of a lady. If Bradlaugh had stood alone he would have been convicted and sentenced there and then. Mrs. Besant saved him; and Mrs. Besant is said by Vanity Fair to be a niece of Lord Hatherley, the wife of a clergyman near Boston, and the sister of a Senior Wrangler. You will assume that she is separated from her husband, and that holding the views she does her husband retains the charge of his girls.
