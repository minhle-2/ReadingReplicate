THE BRADLAUGH-BESANT CASE.
	In the Queen’s Bench Division yesterday, before the Lord Chief Justice and Justice Mellor, the Solicitor-General showed cause against a rule obtained by Mr. Bradlaugh for a correction in the judgment against him and Mrs. Besant. He observed that Mr. Bradlaugh was in error in supposing that this step would enable him to have the case re-argued. His Lordship said it would be a prostitution of justice to go over the case again. The rule was refused with costs.
