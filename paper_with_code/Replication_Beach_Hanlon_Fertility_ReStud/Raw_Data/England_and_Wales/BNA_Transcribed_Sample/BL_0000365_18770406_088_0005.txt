ARREST OF MR. BRADLAUGH
	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, the well-known lecturer, and Mrs. Annie Besant, another Free Thought advocate, were arrested, yesterday morning, by the Leeds police, on the charge of selling a pamphlet, which, it is alleged, is of an immoral nature. The book is entitled “Fruits and Philosophy,” and it has obscene pictures in it. It pretends to relate to the Population question.
