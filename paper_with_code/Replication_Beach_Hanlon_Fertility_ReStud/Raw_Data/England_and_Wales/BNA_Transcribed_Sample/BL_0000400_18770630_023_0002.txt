THE BRADLAUGH PROSECUTION.
THE SENTENCE.
	In the Queen’s Bench Division on Thursday, the Solicitor-General prayed judgment in the case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. Mr. Bradlaugh moved to quash the indictment on the ground that it did not set forth specifically the words charged as obscene. Mrs. Besant argued that the finding of the jury was really a verdict of not guilty, inasmuch as they acquitted the defendants of any corrupt, intention. His Lordship said that she was wrong in her law. If a person did an unlawful act he must abide by it, whatever his motive. The jury had found that the book was obscene, and it was the duty of every good citizen not to set himself above the law to do what he considered a good thing. The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said the case was on e peculiarly for the jury, and there should be no new trial on any of the grounds alleged. The Solicitor-General put in affidavits showing the sale of the work since the verdict. After a consultation with Justice Mellor, his Lordship said had the defendants announced in Court that having acted in error, as the jury found they did, they were ready to submit to the law, the Court was prepared to have allowed them to go at liberty on their own recognisances, but instead of this they had since the verdict set the law at defiance by continuing the publication. The offence now assumed a very grave character. The sentence was that they be each imprisoned for six months and pay a fine of £200, and enter into recognisances in £500 to be of good behavior for two years. On the application of the defendants execution was stayed, to enable them to appeal, they undertaking to cease the publication of the work meanwhile.
