	At the Hall of Science, City-road, London, Mrs. Besant has delivered an address upon the …………………results of the recent prosecution of herself and Mr. Bradlaugh to a crowded assembly. She maintained that the course they had pursued was a right course, and that it was owing to the existence of had laws that as much evil was brought about. In past times reforms had been the result of a defiance of bad Jews. Mr. Bradlaugh and herself were prepared to go to prison, but as soon as that sentence expired they would most certainly again publish the pamphlet which had been condemned, no matter what the consequences ................... might be.
