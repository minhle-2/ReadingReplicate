	People who heard Mrs. Besant’s defence in the trial in which she and Mr. Bradlaugh are defendants say that it was the most remarkable display of feminine ability ever heard. It was masterly production, and seemed to have great weight with the jury, while the Lord Chief Justice highly complimented her upon it. Mrs. Besant is a niece of Lord Hatherley, the wife of a clergyman, and the sister-in-law of a senior wrangler.
