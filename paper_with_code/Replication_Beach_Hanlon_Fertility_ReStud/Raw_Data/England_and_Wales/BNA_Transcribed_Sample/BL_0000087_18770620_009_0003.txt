THE BRADLAUGH TRAIL.
The trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed yesterday morning, when the latter, in continuing her address, called attention to the increased illegitimacy and general depravity which resulted from over-crowding, and to the high death-rate among children, and to baby-farming. At the conclusion of Mrs. Besant’s address Mr. Bradlaugh rose to address the jury. He stated that the book could not be considered obscene according to Lord Campbell’s definition of his own Act. The noble lord had said it was intended to apply exclusively to words written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth, and calculated to shock the nations of common decency. He (Mr. Bradlaugh) had taken up the pamphlet because, as a journalist, he had adopted the Malthusian theory as part of his programme. ---- Mr. Bradlaugh had not concluded when the Court rose.
