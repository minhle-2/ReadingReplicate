Mrs. Besant, the well-known colleague of Mr. Bradlaugh, was announced to give a lecture on the population question last night in the Assembly Rooms, Halifax. The hall was let by the agent without the knowledge of the committee, and when the purpose was discovered the committee cancelled the engagement.
