	The case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, is one which it has been well said, illustrates the defect of our legal system in its want of a public prosecutor. And yet it may be reasonably doubted whether a public prosecutor could have evaded the duty thrust upon the police authorities, challenged as they were, and as he would have been, by the defendants to prosecute them if he dared. When so extreme a Radical as Mr. Holyoake condemns the action of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant as a totally unnecessary vindication of the freedom of the press, we may well hesitate to censure the police for their well meant attempt to suppress a book which even the jury, who wished to acquit the defendants of any base motive, were compelled to declare injurious to public morals. It is better, where possible, to let such books alone; but is it always possible?
