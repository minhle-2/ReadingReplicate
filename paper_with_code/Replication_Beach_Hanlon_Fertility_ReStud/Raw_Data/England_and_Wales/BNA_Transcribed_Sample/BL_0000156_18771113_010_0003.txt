	AN UNPROMISING PROSPECT. Mr. Bradlaugh moved in the Queen’s Bench Division, on the 2nd inst., on behalf of himself and Mrs. Besant, for a rule in regard to certain irregularities in their trial and sentence. The Lord Chief Justice said that if it turned out that there had been irregularity as to which they would hear the Solicitor-General they could set aside the proceedings, have everything done regularly, and pass sentence again, if the defendants thought it worth while that that course should be adopted. A rule nisi was granted.
