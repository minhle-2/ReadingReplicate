SUMMARY
	The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed, yesterday, in the Queen’s Bench Division. Mrs. Besant continued her address, arguing that as the natural cheeks on population, famine and disease, were removed, it was necessary that scientific cheeks should be substituted. Proceeding to treat on the Darwinian doctrine Mrs. Besant observed that Dr. Darwin’s theory could only apply to man on the supposition that the weakly, the aged and the starving were allowed to die without assistance. She proceeded to point out the evils resulting from delaying marriage, and contended that celibacy on the one hand, and profligacy on the other, were far more productive of evil than early marriages. She deprecated the discussion of such subjects in magazines, and she use of physiological works in girls’ schools, but she argued a physical truth could not be morally evil. Mr. Bradlaugh then commenced and continued his address until the Court rose.
