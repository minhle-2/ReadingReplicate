	It is a great argument of the Bradlaugh-Besant faction that bachelors are deterred from venturing upon matrimony by the fear of expensive fecundity. And they urge in favour of their proposed checks to population that by promoting marriage they would diminish immorality. All this sounds very plausible; but the greenest of green young bachelors has sense enough to know that infants are an inexpensive luxury during their earlier years, and the most prudent of prudent young men is scarcely prevented from marrying by a calculation of the cares which a dozen years may bring with them. What eligible bachelors really fear is not so much the expense of prospective children as the expensive habits of the said, prospective children’s mothers. In fact, milliners’ and mantua-makers’ bills are the bogies which scare them away from hymenial bliss. But there is a good time coming! “The Ladies’ Dress Association” will soon commence their mission, under the lofty patronage of duchesses and dames well known in fashionable circles. The Association does not consist of fanatics who wish to plunge womankind into “Bloomer” breeches or Dr. Mary-Walker pantaloons. It is not composed of ascetics who deem ornamental dress a special device of the devil, and who advocate the stern simplicity of Quakerism. The Association has no desire to interfere with that admirable arrangement by which our wives and sisters receive their fashions at the dictation of the Parisian Demi-monde. Its sole object is to render tasteful and lady-like costume a cheap, instead of a dear, commodity. If professes to aim at a capital of 100,000l., and promises 7 per cent. Of course, the secret of the thing is the same as that of the various so called Civil Service Associations vast business and ready money.
