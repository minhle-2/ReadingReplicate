	At the Hall of Science, City-road, London, Mrs. Besant has delivered an address upon the probable realists of the recent prosecution of herself and Mr. Bradlaugh, to a crowded assembly. She maintained that the course they had pursued was a right course, and that it was owing to the existence of bad laws that so much evil was brought about. In past times reforms had been the result of a defiance of bad laws. Mr. Bradlaugh and herself were prepared to go to prison, but as soon as their sentence expired they would most certainly again publish the pamphlet which had been condemned, no matter what the consequences might be.
