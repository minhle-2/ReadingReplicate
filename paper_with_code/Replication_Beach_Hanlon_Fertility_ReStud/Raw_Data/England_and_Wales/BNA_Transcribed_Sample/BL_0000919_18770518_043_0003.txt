THE OPENING OF PARCELS AT THE POST OFFICE.
	Lord JOHN MANNERS, in reply to Mr. P.A. Taylor, stated that he was not aware that any pamphlets by Mr. Bradlaugh or Mrs. Besant had been detained at the post office as indecent publications, but some copies of the Fruits of Philosophy had been detained as such, under the 83rd and 84th Vic. The regulations under the Act were approved of by the Treasury in 1870, and, if desired, could be laid on the table.
