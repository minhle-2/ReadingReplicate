THE BARDLAGH-BESANT CASE.
The trail of Mrs. Besant and Bradlaugh was resumed in the Queen’s Bench yesterday. Mrs. Besant continued her address, arguing that as the natural checks on population such as war, famine, and disease were removed, it was necessary that scientific checks should be instituted. Mr. Bradlaugh addressed the court and had not concluded at the adjournment.
