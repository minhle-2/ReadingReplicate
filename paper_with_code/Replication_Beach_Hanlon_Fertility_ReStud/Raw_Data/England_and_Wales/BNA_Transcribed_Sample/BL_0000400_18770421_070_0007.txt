THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Anne Besant were charged at the London Guildhall on Tuesday with publishing and circulating an immoral book. A large number of “ladies” were present in court, and it would seem that they decided to remain, notwithstanding the significant remarks of the presiding magistrate. The defendant Bradlaugh addressed the court in his own defence, and said he should call a considerable number of witnesses. The case was adjourned. The hearing of the charge was resumed on Thursday at the Guildhall, London. Alderman Figgins refused to admit medical opinion as evidence, and Mr. Bradlaugh resumed his speech, comparing passages in his pamphlet with other works in common circulation. Mrs. Besant also made a statement in defence. The defendants were bound over to appear at the Central Criminal Court, on the 7th May.
