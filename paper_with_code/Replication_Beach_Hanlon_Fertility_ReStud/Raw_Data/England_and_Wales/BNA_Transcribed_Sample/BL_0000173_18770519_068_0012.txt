SEIZURFS IN THE POST OFFICE. – In the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr. P.A. Tayler asked the Postmaster-General whether it was a fact that during the last week a large quantity of publications, including the following, viz: - A newspaper called the National Reformer, three pamphlets written by Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, and a pamphlet entitled “ No. 10 of the Freethinker’s Text-book,” written by Mrs. Besant, have been seized and detained at the General Post Office, under the Act 33rd and 34th Vic., c. 79, sec, 20, as “indecent or obscene;” if he is aware that these publications have been regularly sold without complaint or prosecution; and whether he will lay upon the table a copy of the regulations issued with the approval of the Treasury required by the Act? Lord J. Manners said he was informed that none of the publications specified in the question had been detained in the Post Office, nor did he know anything about the circumstances of their sale or circulation. Some copies of a publication entitled “Fruits of Philosophy,” had been detained under 33rd and 34th Vic, c. 79, as “indecent,” in the words of the Act. Regulations were made under the 20th section of that Act, with the approval of the Treasury, in September, 1870, and if the hon. Gentleman liked to move for a copy, he should be very happy to lay them on the table.
