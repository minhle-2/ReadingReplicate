The sentence which Lord Chief Justice Cockburn passed upon Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, who were convicted by the jury for publishing a pamphlet entitled the “Fruits of Philosophy,” has doubtless exceeded the expectations of most persons, and may elicit considerable surprise. But when the circumstances of the case become known we believe that but little sympathy will be expressed with the two culprits who have been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, etc. It appears that since the jury returned their verdict of guilty, Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant have continued the circulation of their obnoxious work with an evident determination to set the law at defiance. According to Mr. Bradlaugh’s confession and affidavits produced in court the sale of the pamphlet since this conviction has been very extensive. As the Lord Chief Justice stated this disregard of the law gave the case a character of very grave importance, and necessitated much more severe punishment than would otherwise have been inflicted. If this further offence had been allowed to pass unnoticed, it would certainly have tended to foster a spirit of lawless bravado, which would not have tended to promote the good government of the State. Unless the decisions of the law are rigorously enforced they will soon be regarded as worthless, and the public will begin to make laws to suit their own convenience. This is the case in some parts of America at the present day, and a glance at their condition will show that they are by no means an enviable people. Lynch law is frequently resorted to, and the interference of a magistrate of police official is resented with unpleasant violence. However, it need not, we think, be anticipated that we shall drift into this happy state, despite the lawlessness of a few ritualists and others, and we trust that the sentence which has been passed on Mr. Bradlaugh and his co-defendant will have a beneficial effect.
