THE BRADLAUGH – BESANT TRIAL.
	In the course of his summing up, the Lord Chief Justice strongly commented on the mischievous character and effect of the prosecution, which had sent a well-nigh unknown work into a very wide and general circulation.
	The jury retired at a quarter to one, and at twenty minutes past two o’clock returned into court, when the foreman, in answer to the usual question, said: “We are of opinion that the book is calculated to deprave public morals; but we entirely exonerate the defendants from any corrupt motive in publishing it.” 
	A verdict of “Guilty” was entered.
	The Lord Chief Justice said that under the circumstances he would not pass sentence at present, but he would do so that day week, sitting in banco, when the exoneration would be considered, and the points reserved would be discussed.
