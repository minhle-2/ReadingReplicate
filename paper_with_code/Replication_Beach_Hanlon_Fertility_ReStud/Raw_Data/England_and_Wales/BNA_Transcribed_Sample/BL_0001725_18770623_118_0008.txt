PROSECUTION OF CHARLES BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
	Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant surrendered to their recognisances on Monday morning in the Queen’s Bench Division, before the Lord Chief Justice and a special jury, to answer a charge of having, on the 24th March, published an obscene book. Another indictment charged Bradlaugh with having published a similar boon on the 29th of March. A large number of the public assembled in Westminster Hall, and the court was crowded as soon as the doors were opened. The Solicitor-General, Mr. Douglas Straight, and Mr. Mead appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Bradlaugh conducted his defence, and that of his co-defendant, in person. The Solicitor-General said that the defendants were indicted for having published an obscene work. It appeared that a Mr. Watts published some years ago a book which he called “The Fruits of Philosophy; or, Private Companion of Young Married Couples.” It was published in Bristol, and formed the subject of an indictment. Attention having been called to it, the defendants appeared to have come to the conclusion that the result of the case was unsatisfactory, and they determined to ………………………question whether persons were ………….. untitled to publish it, and they accordingly served a notice on the city authorities that they intended to do so. The whole question therefore was, whether this was an obscene book; --After hearing evidence, Mrs. Besant …………summed up for the defence. On Thursday, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, but exonerated the defendants from any had intention. The Lord Chief Justice said the verdict was against the defendants, and ordered them to come up for judgment this day week.
