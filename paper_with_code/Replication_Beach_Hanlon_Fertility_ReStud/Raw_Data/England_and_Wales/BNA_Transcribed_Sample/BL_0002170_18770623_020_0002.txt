MR. C. H. COLLETTE, the secretary and solicitor to the Society for the Suppression of Vice, has given an account of how the  book called  “The Priest in Absolution "—which  the Arch-bishop of Canterbury thinks caught  to be suppressed as an indecent publication—came to lie exposed in the House of Lords. It is explained by Mr. Collette that the Manual of Confession, hearing title given above, was published specially on behalf of a society of Anglican clergymen called “ The Society of the Holy Cross" by a well-known West-end high Church bookseller. By the publisher—who perhaps feared the consequences of a prosecution like the one undertaken against Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant—all the copies were handed over to an official of the Holy Cross Society, to whom people, desirous of making a purchase, were referred. In the meantime, independently of this official,the Committee of the Society for the Suppression of Vice obtained a copy direct  from a member of the Holy Cross community, and, as  it was seen to contain gross and revolting obscenity, they resolved, after giving the subject due consideration, to take steps to bring it to the notice of the Archbishop of Canterbury in his place in the House of Lords. Tots was accordingly done through the agency of Lord Redesdale, and thus it came to pass that the evil, which urgently needed a check, has been brought to the notice of the public in a most practical manner.
