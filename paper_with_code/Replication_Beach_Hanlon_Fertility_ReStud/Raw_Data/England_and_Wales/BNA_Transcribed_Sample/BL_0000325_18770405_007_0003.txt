ARREST OF MR. CHARLES BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT.
	Mr. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant, the well-known Free-thought advocates, were this morning arrested by the City of London police on the charge of printing and publishing a pamphlet, entitled “Hints of Philosophy,” which, it is alleged, is of an immoral nature. The prisoners were brought before the magistrates this afternoon, and the case was adjourned until the 17th inst., bail being accepted.
