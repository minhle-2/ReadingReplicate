The trial of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, for having published an obscene book entitled “The Fruits of Philosophy,” was concluded on Thursday. The jury found the defendants guilty, but exonerated them from any bad intention in publishing the work. Lord Chief Justice Cockburn ordered the defendants to come up for judgement on that day week. The court would then be sitting in banco, and Mr. Bradlaugh could then urge his objection to the indictment.
