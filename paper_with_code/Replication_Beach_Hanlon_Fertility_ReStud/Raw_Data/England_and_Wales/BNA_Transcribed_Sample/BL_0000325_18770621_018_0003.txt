	At the close of Mr. Bradlaugh’s address to the jury in the prosecution against him and Mrs. Besant in the Queen’s Bench Division yesterday, several witnesses were called to prove that the pamphlet alleged to be of an obscene character contained nothing that was not to be found in medical books. This closed the defendants’ case, and the Court rose.
