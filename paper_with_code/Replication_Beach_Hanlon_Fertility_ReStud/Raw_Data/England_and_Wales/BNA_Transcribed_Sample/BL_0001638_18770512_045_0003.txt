POPULATION V. TRUTH OF PHILOSOPHY.
To the Editor of the Barnsley Chronicle. 
		Mr. Editor, Of all the “crazes” that ever arise to vex the brain and disturb all that is right, good, and holy in society the Mal. Malthusian “craze” is the biggest and the worst. It is the direct charge of folly and wrong upon the Almighty Himself in asserting that He has so planned the world that its feeding power is not equal and co-relative to its breeding power. And thus the craries try to show that in certain places and at certain times this appears to be so. But they over look the facts and follies of men in restricting production by tying up both land, labour, and capital from the multitude. And they overlook the fact that under free trade, and by art and science, wealth, trade, and commerce have increased far more and faster than population, when population has increased more than ever known of Mr. Frith, the miners’ secretary, should know this. He knows that the miners have earned wealth to others far more than would maintain all their over natural increase. He knows, or ought to know, that the fault is not in the increase of workers of wealth, but in the monopoly or rather unfair share of the proceeds that our present social evils arise. And if we do annually grow too thick at Barnsley, a wise and sound system of national emigration could and should transplant our surplus population to other lands better adapted to give and spread to us the especial thing we lack-viz. corn, cattle, cotton, and wool. We could then give them back iron, clothing, and the thousand things we excel in. Away then with the blasphemy of blaming God for the errors and mistakes of men, and away with the sin of restricting our right and wholesome power of production of either wealth or wealth makers, Bradlaugh, Besant, and Mr. Frith notwithstanding.
