THE BRADLAUGH-BESANT PROSECUTION
LONDON, TUESDAY
The trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed to-day in the Court of Queen’s Bench, Mrs. Besant continued her address, arguing, that as the natural checks on population --- war, famine, and disease --- were removed, it was necessary that scientific checks should be substituted. Proceeding to treat of the Darwinian doctrine of the survival of the fittest, the Lord Chief Justice remarked it was well worthy of Mr. Darwin’s consideration whether, while in the struggle for existence, a still higher and more gifted race might come in the smaller number, yet the effect upon the masses might be deteriorating. Mrs. Besant observed that Mr. Darwin’s theory could only apply to man on the supposition that the weakly, the aged, and the starving were allowed to die without assistance. She proceeded to point out the evils resulting from delaying marriage, and contended that celibacy on the one hand and profligacy on the other were far more productive of evil that early marriages. She deprecated the discussion of such subjects in magazines and the use of physiological works in girl’s schools, but she argued a physical truth could not be morally evil, Mr.  Bradlaugh then commenced his address until the court arose.
