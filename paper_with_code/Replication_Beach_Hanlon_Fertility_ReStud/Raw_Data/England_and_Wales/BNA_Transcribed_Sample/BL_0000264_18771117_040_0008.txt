     MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT
	Yesterday, in the Queen’s Bench Division, before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and Mr. Justice Mellor, the Solicitor-General, on the part of the Crown, showed cause against a rule which had been obtained by the defendants calling upon the prosecution to show cause why the judgment-roll should not be completed by inserting in it the actual date when the interlocutory judgment was signed and posted, and why the time for the defendants to transcribe the said judgment-roll should not be enlarged, and why any further proceedings should not be stayed in the meantime. The application, as for as he was aware, was unprecedented. The judgment was regular in form, and it was duly recorded.
	Mrs. Besant and Mr. Bradlaugh argued that it was absolutely necessary that the informality of not signing the interlocutory judgment before final judgment was pronounced should be corrected before they could proceed with their writ of error.
	Their lordships, expressing their regret that the time of the court should have been wasted on a trumpery technicality, discharged the rule with costs.
