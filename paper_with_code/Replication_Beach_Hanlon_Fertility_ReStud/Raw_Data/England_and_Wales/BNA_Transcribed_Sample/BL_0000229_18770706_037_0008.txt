It is being whispered that the Bradlaugh-Besant prosecution will after all collapse on a technicality. There has been some laxity in the Crown Office ---- so it is said --- which will have the effect of vitiating the entire proceedings anterior to the verdict of the jury. It is extremely unlikely that Mr. Bradlaugh, or his co-defendant, will neglect to take full advantage of this flaw, and we may, therefore, assume that what the Daily News calls “a vindictive sentence” will never be enforced. It does not seem likely, however, that this fortunate escape for the new apostles of Malthus will have the effect of staying the propagation of their pernicious doctrines, for Bradlaugh himself told his followers at Northampton the other night, that even if the sentence is carried on the sale of the book until the law is altered. Let us hope that in the end the law will prove too strong for him. In any case, it does not excuse the legal bungling about this prosecution which the Judges from the Bench have already condemned.
