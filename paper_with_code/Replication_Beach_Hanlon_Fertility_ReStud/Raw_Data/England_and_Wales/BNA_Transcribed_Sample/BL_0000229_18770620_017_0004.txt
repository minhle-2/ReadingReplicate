THE TRAIL OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT
The trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was resumed yesterday in the Queen’s Bench.  Mrs. Besant continued her address, arguing, that as the natural checks on population such as war, famine, and disease, were removed, it was necessary that scientific checks should be substituted. Mrs. Besant was proceeding to treat of the Darwinian doctrine of the survival of the fittest, when the Lord Chief Justice remarked it might be worthy of Mr. Darwin’s consideration whether, the result of the struggle for existence was not twofold, namely that beneath the small numbers of a highly gifted race a deteriorated race would be engendered. --- Mrs. Besant having contained her arguments on the case, was followed by Mr. Bradlaugh, who had not concluded his address when the Court arose.
