THE FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY
THAT the surest way to make a book sell is to prohibit the sale of it, has been exemplified i9n a convincing manner, by the effects of the BRADLAUGH prosecution on the sale of the “Fruits of Philosophy.” Mr. BRADLAUGH visited Bristol on Monday last, with the intention of forming a branch of the Malthusian league, and at the meeting he stated that although the sale of the “Fruits of Philosophy” used to be about 100 a year, since the prosecution of himself and Mrs. BESANT, over 130,000 copies had been sold. He stated that, if defeated in the Court of Error, he should carry the case to the Court of Appeal, and, if necessary, to the House of Lords; and if beaten there he would go to Holloway Gaol, and still continue to publish the book. This is a proof that the general verdict of the public is a correct one, viz. that it was an egregious mistake to prosecute the publishers, for the sale of the book since proceedings were taken to stop it has been many times the number that would have been circulated if it had been let alone. The antidote proposed has caused the poison to circulate with an increased and increasing virulence, and each further more on the part of the Government will only add fuel to the fire.
