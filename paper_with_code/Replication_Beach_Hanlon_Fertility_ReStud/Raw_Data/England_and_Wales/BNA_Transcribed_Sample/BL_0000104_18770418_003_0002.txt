	The case in which Mr. C. Bradlaugh and Mrs. A. Besant were charged with publishing an obscene book, entitled “Fruits of Philosophy,” came on in the Guildhall police court on Tuesday. The objectionable passages were pointed out to the magistrate, who read them sotto voce, there being in the court several ladies, who, Mr. Bradlaugh said, would be called as witnesses for the defence. In his address Mr. Bradlaugh contended that the pamphlet did not come within the meaning of the Acts dealing with obscene literature. The case was adjourned until Thursday.
