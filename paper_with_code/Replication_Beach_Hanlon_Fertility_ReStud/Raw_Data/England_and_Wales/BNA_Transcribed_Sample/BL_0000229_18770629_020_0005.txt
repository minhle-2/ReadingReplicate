THE SENTENCE ON MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT

In the Queen’s Bench Division, yesterday, the Solicitor-General prayed judgement in the case of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant. Mr. Bradlaugh moved to quash the indictment on technical grounds, and Mrs. Besant urged that the verdict, which acquitted them of evil intent, was really one of not guilty. The Lord Chief Justice ruled that there could be no new trail. ---- Affidavits were put in showing that defendants had sold the pamphlet since the verdict. ---- After consultation, the Lord Chief Justice said that rendered the case much more difficult. Had they submitted to the law, they might have been released on their own recognisance, but they had set it as defiance. The sentence was that they be each imprisoned for six months, pay a fine of £200, and enter into recognisances in £500 to be of good behaviour for two years. On the application of the defendants, execution was stayed to enable them to appeal, on the understanding not to sell the book in the meanwhile.
