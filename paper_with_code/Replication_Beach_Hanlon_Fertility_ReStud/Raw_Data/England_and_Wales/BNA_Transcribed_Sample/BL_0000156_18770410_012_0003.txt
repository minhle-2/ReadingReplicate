LAW INTELLIGENCE
	PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH – Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, the editor, and Mrs. Annie Besant, subeditor, of the National Reformer, were on Thursday arrested and taken before Mr. Alderman Figgins at the Guildhall Justice-room, charged with the publication of a book, The Fruits of Philosophy, which deals with the Malthusian theory as to population, and is alleged to be of an immoral nature. The work is one upon which a prosecution has already been founded, and as a result it was withdrawn from circulation ; but it has now been re-issued, with the avowed object of testing whether it is, as alleged, and immoral one. The proceedings were merely formal, the hearing of the case being adjourned until Tuesday, the 17th instant. The defendants meanwhile were admitted to bail in two sureties of £100 each, and themselves in £200 each.
