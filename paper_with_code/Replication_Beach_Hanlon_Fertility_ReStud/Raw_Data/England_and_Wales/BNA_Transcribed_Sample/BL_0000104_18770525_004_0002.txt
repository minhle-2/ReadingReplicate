	Every bane has its antidote. I question, however, whether the necessary corrective to Mr. Bradlaugh’s book is to be found in the two-penny pamphlet which is now selling in the streets, and which professes to give some moral “Fruits of Philosophy” for both sexes. It is evidently got up with the object of inducing people to buy a collection of moral aphorisms under the impression that they are investing in something very naughty indeed. On the title page the words “Fruits of Philosophy,” “Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant” stand out in bold letters, and there are such suggestive lines as “the passions and affections, the art of love, the pleasures of courtship and choice of lovers, chaste counsel for the wedding day.” &e. When the contents of the pamphlet come to be examined, however, they are found to consist of some very mild moral maxims professing to be called from “The Ancient Chinese Bible, Thousands of Years Old,” composed from manuscripts translated in the early part of the 18th century, by the learned Ambassador of the Emperor of China, from the Sacred Volume of Holy Scriptures concealed for ages upon the summit of a lofty mountain in the Great Temple of the Grand Lama and High Priest of Thibet.” We all know of wolves in sheep’s clothing, but this is, perhaps, the first instance of a sheet appearing in wolf’s clothing.
