THE “FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY.”
Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant attended before Sri Thomas Dakin, at the Guildhall police court on Saturday, in order to protect themselves in the eyes of the public and the Court of Queen’s Bench. Mr. Bradlaugh said that he and Mrs. Besant had been committed from that court for trial, and they were tried and convicted in the Court of Queen’s Bench, but pending an appeal from that conviction they were let out on their own nominal recognisances, they pledging their words of honour to do nothing either directly or indirectly to assist the publication of the book, but, on the contrary, to do all in their power to suppress the sale of it. It had come to their knowledge that Messrs. Martin, Boundy, and Co., of 30, Ludgate hill, were sending out circulars stating that they were ready to supply a copy of the pamphlet for private circulation for 3s, the book having been previously sold at 6d a copy. Sir Thomas Dakin said he presumed that Mr. Bradlaugh made that statement in defence of himself and Mrs. Besant, to show that they had nothing to do with the circulation. Mr. Bradlaugh said that was precisely the case. They did not wish it to be believed that he and Mrs. Besant were taking advantage of their liberty to play fast and loose with the court which had shown them so much courtesy. Sir Thomas Dakin said he thought it was a case which the police ought to take up. Inspector Pitney said he would report the case to the commissioner. Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant thanked Sri Thomas Dakin for his courtesy, and retired.
