THE BRADLAUGH CASE – The jury, after a four days’ hearing, have found that the book published by Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was calculated to deprave public morals, but that they had no bad intention in publishing it. The Lord Chief Justice said the finding was against the defendants, whom he directed to appear for judgment next Thursday, when Mr. Bradlaugh will have an opportunity of arguing his technical objection to the indictment.
