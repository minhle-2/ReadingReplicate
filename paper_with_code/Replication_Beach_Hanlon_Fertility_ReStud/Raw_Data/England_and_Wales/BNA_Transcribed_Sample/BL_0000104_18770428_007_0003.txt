THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH
	In the Queen’s Bench Division on Friday morning, (before Lord Chief Justice Cookburn and Mr. Justice Mellor), Mr. Bradlaugh moved for a writ of certiorari to bring up the joint committal of himself and Mrs. Annie Besant, in order that it might be tried in this division before a special jury. They had been committed for trial at the next sessions of the Central Criminal Court, on a charge of misdemeanour for having published an obscene book, and in the ordinary course the indictment would be laid before the grand jury on the 7th May.
	The Lord Chief Justice said: The fate of this application must depend upon the real and true nature of this work. If, upon looking at it, we think that its object is the legitimate one of promoting knowledge upon a matter of public interest, then we should be inclined to prevent the occurrence of a miscarriage of justice by allowing the case to be tried before a special jury. If, on the other hand, we think that the scientific character attributed to the work is a mere pretense and cover for indecency we shall allow the ordinary procedure to prevail, and the case must be tried in the Central Criminal Court in due course. It appearing that this is a bend fide attempt to determine the character of the work the defendants may remain on bail on their own recognisances. 
	Judgment postponed.
