THE TRAIL OF MR. BRADLAUGH AND MRS. BESANT
The trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant was concluded yesterday. ---- Mr. Bradlaugh having summed up for the defence, and the Solicitor-General having briefly replied, the Lord Chief Justice said a more ill-advised prosecution was never brought into Court of Justice. --- The jury, after an absence of 1 hour and 35 minutes, found that the book was calculated to deprave the public morals, but they entirely exonerated the defendants from any corrupt motive in publishing it. ---- The Lord Chief Justice then said: “I am afraid, gentlemen, I must direct you, on that, to find against them. Tour exoneration of any corrupt intention will be taken into consideration, but I must direct you, on the special verdict, to find against the defendants. ---- The jury accordingly found a verdict guilty. ---- The Lord Chief Justice would not then pass sentence, and defendants were released, on their own recognisances, to come up in a week for judgement.
