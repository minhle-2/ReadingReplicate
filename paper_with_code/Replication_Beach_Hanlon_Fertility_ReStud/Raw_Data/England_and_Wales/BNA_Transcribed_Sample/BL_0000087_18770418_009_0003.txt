THE PROSECUTION OF MR. BRADLAUGH
The trail of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant for publishing a book said to be immoral, called “Fruits of Philosophy,” commenced at the Guildhall, London, yesterday. Several women were present in court, amongst them being Mr. Bradlaugh’s daughters, and as counsel proceed to read extracts from the book, the magistrates suggested that it would be becoming if they withdrew. Mr. Bradlaugh stated that ladies were his witnesses, and as the would not leave the objectionable passages were pointed out and handed to the magistrate to read. The publication of the work having been proved, Mr. Bradlaugh replied at considerable length, and intimated his intention to call several leading authors and publishers to prove that there was nothing in the “Fruits of Philosophy” which is not contained in other works of undisputed standing and of the highest character.
