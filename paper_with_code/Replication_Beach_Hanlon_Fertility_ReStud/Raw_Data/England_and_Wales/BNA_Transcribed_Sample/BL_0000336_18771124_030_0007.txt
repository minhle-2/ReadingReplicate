DR. KENEALY’S “MILLION SIXPENCES.”—It will be remembered that two or three months ago Dr. Kenealy invited the working' people of England to subscribe a million of sixpences (£25,000), and with this sum he proposed to change the constitution of the House of Commons and fill St. Stephen's with men pledged to obtain the release of the Claimant, and, if after that had been achieved, there should be any funds available, to advance the principles of " Magna Charta" generally. It would seem, however, that the working people have responded very slowly to the aplent appeal made to their patriotism.—A London paper states that on Wednesday the hon. member for Stoke issued the following statement respecting his appeal:—" I am sorry that this proposal, intended to raise an election fund for the release of Roger Tichborne, and the advancement of Magna Charta, is likely to be a failure. The enemy are crowing loudly. Be it so! I have done my duty, and if the people will not do theirs I am power-less. Bradlaugh and Besant raised £1,200 in a few weeks. Little more than £20 has been sent to Me.—E. V. KENEALY."
